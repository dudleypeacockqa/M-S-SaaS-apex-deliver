Most dealmakers and finance teams juggle 5-10 disconnected tools: Excel for cash forecasting, separate CRM for deal pipeline, email for data rooms, and manual processes for valuation. CapLiquify provides a unified platform for 13-week direct cash forecasting, working capital optimization (DSO/DPO/DIO), and lender-ready reporting. ApexDeliver adds AI-powered deal sourcing, secure data rooms, multi-method valuation, and PMI Finance Ops Stabilisation—all in one integrated system."},{q:"How do you ingest bank data and transaction history?",a:"At MVP, we support three integration methods: (1) Sage Intacct API integration for real-time GL data sync, (2) Odoo ERP integration for manufacturing and distribution businesses, and (3) CSV import for manual data upload. We do NOT use third-party bank aggregators to maintain compliance and data security. All data flows through encrypted channels and is stored in EU (Frankfurt) with schema-per-tenant isolation."},{q:"Which accounting systems and ERPs are supported?",a:"Currently supported: Sage Intacct (full API integration), Odoo (full API integration), and CSV imports (manual). Coming soon: QuickBooks Online, Xero, and NetSuite. We prioritize integrations based on customer demand and focus on mid-market ERPs used by PE-backed businesses."},{q:"Can I model multiple scenarios for cash flow and M&A deals?",a:"Yes. CapLiquify FP&A includes multi-scenario modeling for cash flow forecasting (base case, best case, worst case). ApexDeliver Professional and above include scenario modeling for deal structures, offer stacks, and post-merger integration timelines. You can save, compare, and share scenarios with your team or lenders."},{q:"What is PMI Finance Ops Stabilisation (Option B)?",a:"This is our flagship post-merger integration service for Enterprise and Portfolio customers. Within 2-4 weeks of deal close, we stabilize your finance operations: map chart of accounts, reconcile opening balances, establish 13-week cash forecasting, implement working capital tracking, and generate lender-ready packs. This is a £30k one-time package that ensures your acquired business has clean financials from day one."}]},{category:"Security & Compliance",questions:[{q:"What is your security posture?",a:"Enterprise-grade security with EU (Frankfurt) primary data residency. We use schema-per-tenant database isolation (not row-level), TLS 1.3 encryption in transit, AES-256 encryption at rest, field-level encryption for sensitive data via KMS, and Clerk authentication with MFA and SSO support. We maintain 7-year immutable audit logs, daily encrypted backups with 30-day retention, and quarterly disaster recovery tests. RTO is 4 hours, RPO is 1 hour."},{q:"Are you GDPR and PECR compliant?",a:"Yes. All data is stored in EU (Frankfurt) with USA as DR/failover only. We are GDPR compliant with data processing agreements available. We do not use third-party bank aggregators, which simplifies compliance. Our cookie policy is PECR compliant, and we provide data export and deletion capabilities for GDPR subject access requests."},{q:"How do you handle multi-tenancy and data isolation?",a:"We use schema-per-tenant isolation, not row-level security. Each customer gets a dedicated database schema, ensuring complete data separation. This architecture prevents data leakage and provides better performance than shared-table multi-tenancy. All queries are scoped to the tenant schema at the application layer."},{q:"What is your uptime SLA?",a:"99.9% for FP&A and Professional tiers, 99.95% for Enterprise and Portfolio tiers. We use cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling, load balancing, and geographic redundancy. Our monitoring detects issues within 60 seconds, and we have automated failover to DR region.
