# 100% Completion Roadmap

## Phase 0 – Governance Reset & Baseline

- Refresh `docs/bmad/bmm-workflow-status.md`, `docs/bmad/BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`, and deployment logs with today’s state after verifying backend/ frontend health via curl.  Cite new snapshots in `docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md`.
- Catalogue every dirty/staged file (valuation, marketing, podcast, scripts) and map each to an active BMAD story (e.g., `DEV-011`, `DEV-016`, `MARK-002`). Document linkage in the relevant story files under `docs/bmad/stories/`.
- Run `npx bmad-method status` → advance to the correct workflow (`/bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story`) and log NEXT_ACTION/COMMAND/AGENT before implementation begins.

## Phase 1 – Stabilize Current In-Flight Work

- For Valuation Suite (`frontend/src/pages/deals/valuation/ValuationSuite.tsx`, related tests/schemas), turn any skipped/ failing specs RED, drive them GREEN, and align backend endpoints (`backend/app/api/routes/valuation.py`, `backend/tests/test_valuation_api.py`).
- Finalize podcast quota + entitlement changes (`backend/app/services/quota_service.py`, `backend/tests/test_quota_service.py`, `frontend/src/pages/podcast/PodcastStudio.tsx`) ensuring Alembic migration `de0a8956401c` is recorded with TDD.
- Resolve marketing test regressions in `frontend/src/components/marketing/*` and `frontend/src/pages/marketing/EnhancedLandingPage.test.tsx`, keeping copy/fixture docs in sync.
- After each sub-step: update story docs, rerun targeted pytest/Vitest suites, and capture metrics in `BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`.

## Phase 2 – Financial Integrations Completion

- Replace temporary mocks with full QuickBooks, Sage, and NetSuite integrations mirroring the Xero pattern (touch `backend/app/services/integrations/*`, new tests under `backend/tests/test_financial_integrations_*.py`).
- Expand financial intelligence analytics and ensure coverage ≥90% via new TDD suites.
- Update developer guides (`docs/FINANCIAL_INTEGRATIONS.md`) and BMAD stories for DEV-010/DEV-012 equivalents.

## Phase 3 – Podcast Studio Feature Set (DEV-016)

- Implement remaining backend services (transcription, YouTube publishing, streaming) with quota enforcement and entitlement middleware (`backend/app/services/podcast_service.py`, API routes, Celery tasks if needed) using RED→GREEN loops.
- Build corresponding frontend experiences (feature gates, upgrade CTAs, quota HUD) within `frontend/src/pages/podcast/PodcastStudio.tsx` and tests.
- Document and verify across BMAD stories, update Alembic migrations if schema changes occur, and record coverage.

## Phase 4 – Task Management & Workflow Automation (F-004)

- Deliver backend task workflow APIs (`backend/app/api/routes/tasks.py`, services/models/tests) and frontend UI (`frontend/src/pages/tasks/TaskBoard.tsx`) under TDD.
- Integrate notifications/automations; ensure story docs and BMAD progress capture RED→GREEN journey.

## Phase 5 – Marketing & Growth Assets (MARK-002+)

- Complete remaining marketing assets (images, SEO, analytics) updating `frontend/public/`, `frontend/src/pages/marketing/`, and associated tests.
- Produce Lighthouse/perf reports, add results to `docs/marketing/` and BMAD trackers, confirm coverage ≥90% for marketing suites.

## Phase 6 – Advanced Intelligence & Community Features

- Implement remaining epics: intelligent deal matching (Claude), automated document generation, event management, and community hub—each kicked off via BMAD story workflows with backend + frontend TDD coverage.
- Add AI integration tests/mocks, update documentation (`docs/ai/`, story files) and ensure security/performance reviews.

## Phase 7 – Final QA, Deployment, and Handover

- Run full test matrices (pytest with coverage, `npm run test -- --coverage`, smoke scripts) and resolve any regressions.
- Execute Render deployment checklist, capture curl + Lighthouse evidence in `DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md` and operations logs.
- Prepare final BMAD retrospective updates, confirm NEXT_ACTION closed, and draft release notes/PR summary noting 100% completion.
