## Content Strategy

### Delivery Status (2025-10-30 QA)
- **Build:** Blog API routing and seed data remain broken; marketing site shows "No posts yet".
- **Measure:** Add Vitest contract tests + Playwright smoke before re-publishing.
- **Analyze:** Monitor Render logs and Search Console crawl after fix.
- **Decide:** Resume content release once the blog API serves JSON and marketing pages pass the updated verification checklist.
