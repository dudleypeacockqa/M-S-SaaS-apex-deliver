## Production Notes

- **Music**: Upbeat, driving beat (think "tech startup" instrumental). Starts chaotic/tense during the Excel section, drops into a smooth, clean beat when CapLiquify appears.
- **Color Grading**:
    - **Excel Section**: Slightly desaturated, cool blue/grey tones. High contrast.
    - **CapLiquify Section**: Bright, warm, clean whites and emerald greens (brand colors).
- **Voiceover**: Professional, energetic, but not "salesy". Sounds like a peer who understands the pain.
