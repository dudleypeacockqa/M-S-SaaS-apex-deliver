# Story: Platform Status Verification (OPS-004)

**Status**: In Progress â€“ Manual Follow-up Required  
**Checked On**: 2025-10-24 13:05 UTC  
**Related Docs**: docs/RENDER_CONFIGURATION_FIX.md, docs/CODEX_STATUS_CHECK_RESPONSE.md, docs/bmad/prd.md

## Findings
- Remote connectivity confirmed: `git ls-remote origin` resolves to commit `8bed354` on `origin/main`.
- Latest local worktree commit: `3a5f7c4 feat(frontend): add serve for production web service deployment` (created via CODEX). Commit exists locally only.
- `git push origin main` fails with `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled`, indicating missing GitHub credentials in the CODEX environment.
- Render frontend (`srv-d3ihptbipnbc73e72ne0`, url `https://ma-saas-platform.onrender.com`) shows deploy `live` at 2025-10-24T10:43:02Z with trigger `new_commit` (commit `ad34b2682a32a8cfac713b60901e6ad545475901`).
- Render backend (`srv-d3ii9qk9c44c73aqsli0`, url `https://ma-saas-backend.onrender.com`) latest deploy (2025-10-24T11:48:22Z) status `update_failed` for commit `97e03aa408725d268c26228633a82b6648be2926` ("fix(backend): resolve circular import in database base class").
- Local working tree remains heavily modified relative to origin (multiple backend/front-end/doc files). No additional commits created in this session beyond `3a5f7c4`.

## Outstanding Actions (manual workstation)
1. Configure GitHub credentials (PAT or SSH) and rerun `git push origin main` to publish commit `3a5f7c4`, or cherry-pick onto a clean branch before pushing.
2. Review Render backend deploy logs for failure details; repair build/runtime issue and trigger a manual redeploy once resolved.
3. Validate frontend at `https://apexdeliver.com` and backend health at `https://ma-saas-backend.onrender.com/health` after redeploy.
4. Update this story to **Done** with references to the successful backend deploy and pushed commit hash once actions are complete.

## Blockers
- CODEX environment lacks interactive GitHub credentials, preventing pushes from this session.
- Backend deploy failing upstream; remediation requires repository changes and redeploy.

## Next Steps
- Perform the outstanding actions on a workstation with GitHub credentials and direct Render access.
- Record resolution timestamps and deployment IDs in BMAD progress artifacts.
