## Summary
- Backend service `ma-saas-backend` redeployed successfully at 2025-10-24T12:21:39Z (deploy `dep-d3tmtd56ubrc73ft48l0`, commit `820370671f966872808a6dc11fc105e699b09d4c`).
- Frontend service `ma-saas-platform` remains live from deploy `dep-d3tmqkffte5s73eksa40` (commit `248afeef08119b4fc6ea8a9213f25bfd23158047`).
- Render health checks returning HTTP 200 (`GET /health`) during deploy window confirm service availability.
- Local commit `3a5f7c4 feat(frontend): add serve for production web service deployment` still pending push from a workstation with GitHub credentials.

## Verification Evidence
- Render API reports backend status `live` with `updatedAt: 2025-10-24T12:21:12.45895Z` and frontend status `live` with `updatedAt: 2025-10-24T12:14:16.037376Z`.
- Backend deploy logs show Uvicorn startup complete and successive `200 OK` responses for `/health` during Render verification probes.
- Image build cached layers and upload finished without error (`Upload succeeded`, `Your service is live ðŸŽ‰`).

## Follow-Up Actions
1. Configure GitHub credentials (PAT or SSH) locally and push commit `3a5f7c4`, or cherry-pick onto a clean branch before pushing.
2. Monitor subsequent commits to ensure Render auto-deploys continue to succeed.
3. Keep BMAD progress tracker in sync with future deployment checks.

### Update 2025-10-24T12:34Z
- Backend deploy dep-d3tmx0f69nk73emvkbg from commit 2e28ca72b9269f6703156659cde9f48c33409531 built and returned consecutive 200 responses on /health.
- Frontend build dep-d3tmx3jm7s1s73fbm2g0 failed on first attempt due to Vite config typings; fixed by isolating Vitest config and rerunning build locally.
- Next redeploy pending after pushing updated config.
