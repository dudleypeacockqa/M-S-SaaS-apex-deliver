# DEV-011: Multi-Method Valuation Suite

**Story ID**: DEV-011  
**Sprint**: Sprint 5 (Phase 1 Completion)  
**Priority**: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (Core Differentiator)  
**Estimated Effort**: 20-24 hours (TDD end-to-end)  
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha + Test-Driven Development (strict RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)  
**Status**: üü† Backend Complete ‚Äì UI/Exports Pending (Updated 2025-10-28 23:35 UTC)

**Latest Update (2025-10-29 06:33 UTC)**:
- RED ‚Üí GREEN: `ValuationSuite.test.tsx` Monte Carlo accessibility + payload assertion now passes (`npm --prefix frontend test -- ValuationSuite.test.tsx` ‚Üí 12/12 GREEN).
- Added explicit label associations + input normalisation in `ValuationSuite.tsx` Monte Carlo panel to ensure deterministic payloads (iterations clamped ‚â•50, seed optional).
- Catalogued active WIP for Phase 1 stabilization: `frontend/src/pages/deals/valuation/ValuationSuite.tsx`, `frontend/src/pages/deals/valuation/ValuationSuite.test.tsx`, `frontend/src/services/api/valuations.ts`, backend valuation routes/schemas/tests, and shared fixture tweaks in `backend/tests/conftest.py`.

**Update (2025-10-28 23:35 UTC)**:
- Monte Carlo API now typed (`MonteCarloRequest`/`MonteCarloResponse`) with deterministic seeding and validation. `pytest backend/tests/test_valuation_api.py` + `test_financial_models_sync.py` green.
- Full backend regression (`pytest backend/tests -q`) passes with **380 passed / 21 skipped**; coverage steady at ~83%.
- Frontend ValuationSuite wiring remains in progress (analytics cards, scenario editing, export CTA UX) ‚Äî keep Vitest suite GREEN while adding new assertions.

**Update (2025-10-28 21:47 UTC)**:
- Ran RED ‚Üí GREEN cycle on `ValuationSuite.test.tsx`, expanding analytics expectations to include EV/Equity range bands and dynamic upgrade messaging.
- Summary tab now renders five insight cards (count, EV/Equity medians, EV/Equity ranges) with formatted currency values sourced from `getScenarioSummary`.
- Growth-tier gate surfaces API-supplied messaging, CTA URL, and tier labels; fallback copy retained for legacy responses.
- Next: Layer scenario editing UX and export queue status into the workspace before closing DEV-011.

**Update (2025-10-28 18:43 UTC)**:
- Scenario analytics panel and Growth-tier upgrade CTA implemented in `ValuationSuite.tsx`; valuation workspace Vitest suite now 9/9 GREEN.
- `npm run test -- ValuationSuite.test.tsx` confirms scenario summary + 403 gating specs pass; Summary view now calls `getScenarioSummary` eagerly for analytics cards.
- Next: Continue DEV-011 backlog with scenario editing + export polish while prepping to transition to DEV-016 podcast gating per cross-feature plan.

**Update (2025-10-28 18:27 UTC)**:
- `frontend/src/pages/deals/valuation/ValuationSuite.test.tsx` now GREEN (6 passed / 2 skipped) after Vitest run; skipped cases cover scenario analytics + growth-tier gating awaiting implementation.
- Backend valuation CRUD/API suites remain GREEN from prior Phase 2 runs; no regressions observed during governance sync.
- Next: promote the two skipped specs to RED and deliver scenario analytics plus tier gating UI to achieve full GREEN.

## üìñ User Stories & Business Context

1. **As a** solo or growth-tier dealmaker **I want to** build Discounted Cash Flow valuations with AI-assisted assumptions **so that** I can quickly produce defensible valuation ranges for targets.
2. **As a** platform analyst **I want to** compare my target company against public and precedent transactions **so that** I can triangulate valuation using multiple methodologies.
3. **As a** platform admin **I want** every valuation to be stored, versioned, and exportable **so that** our clients can produce investor-ready materials with audit trails.

**Strategic Importance**: The valuation suite is the capstone of the Phase 1 roadmap. It transforms the platform from a workflow tool into an intelligence engine that advisors can trust for high-stakes deals. Completion unlocks premium tier upsell (Professional+), supports ARR projections, and is a prerequisite for DEV-012 automated deal books.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

### AC-11.1 DCF Valuation Engine
- System captures historical financials (Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, Net Income, FCFF) and five-year projections.
- Users can set WACC, terminal value method (Gordon Growth / Exit Multiple), and working capital assumptions.
- Engine calculates enterprise value, equity value, and implied share price. 
- Sensitivity matrix (¬±2% WACC, ¬±2% terminal growth) auto-computed.
- Narrative summary flags primary value drivers and risks.

### AC-11.2 Comparable Companies Analysis
- Users can import or manually add comparable companies with EBITDA, Revenue, and valuation multiples.
- Automated retrieval of multiples from stored financial intel (Phase 1 uses manual entry + CSV import; API hooks stubbed for future enhancements).
- Output displays min/median/max multiples and implied valuation range for the subject company.
- Users can weight comparables and exclude outliers; UI reflects adjustments instantly.

### AC-11.3 Precedent Transactions Module
- Users can record transaction comps (deal date, buyer, target, transaction value, EBITDA/Revenue multiples).
- Module computes average/median multiples and adjusts for time decay (transactions older than 36 months flagged).
- Deal notes captured for audit and export.
- Implied valuation range derived and consolidated with other methodologies.

### AC-11.4 Scenario & Sensitivity Management
- Users can create named scenarios (Base, Upside, Downside) with distinct assumptions.
- Tornado chart summarises top five valuation drivers with delta impact (frontend renders using Chart.js or equivalent).
- Monte Carlo simulation stub (100 iterations) available with seeded random for deterministic tests; UI displays summary (mean, P10, P90).

### AC-11.5 Reporting & Exports
- Valuation summary exportable to PDF (server-side templating) and Excel/CSV for raw model data.
- AI generates executive summary bullet points per scenario.
- Report artifacts stored in document room and linked to deal automatically.
- All exports logged with timestamp and user for compliance.

### AC-11.6 RBAC & Tier Enforcement
- Valuation workspace accessible to Growth tier and above (Professional, Enterprise, Community, Admin).
- Starter tier users see upgrade CTA when accessing valuation routes.
- Backend enforces org + role permissions; unauthorized access returns 403 with structured error payload.

### AC-11.7 Operational Excellence
- Minimum 90% backend coverage for valuation modules; 85%+ for frontend valuation components.
- End-to-end regression ensures DCF + comparables workflows survive CLI smoke tests.
- Render deployment pipeline updated; health endpoints reflect valuation readiness flag.
- BMAD tracker, story summary, and deployment checklist updated at completion.

## üß† Technical Specifications

### Backend Architecture
- **Models**: `ValuationModel`, `ValuationScenario`, `ComparableCompany`, `PrecedentTransaction`, `ValuationExportLog` with multi-tenant enforcement (`organization_id` on every table).
- **Services**: `valuation_service.py` handles DCF math, comparables aggregation, sensitivity analysis, and orchestrates AI narrative generation (OpenAI GPT-4). Monte Carlo implemented with NumPy (seeded for tests).
- **APIs**: REST routes under `/api/deals/{deal_id}/valuation/*` for DCF CRUD, comparables CRUD, scenario management, export triggers, and summary retrieval.
- **Storage**: Exports saved via existing document service; valuations link to `Document` entries for browsing.
- **Security**: All routes require authenticated user in same organization with `require_min_role("growth")` guard.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pages**: `ValuationSuite.tsx` (tabbed workspace), `ValuationScenarioModal.tsx`, `ComparablesTable.tsx`, `PrecedentTransactionsTable.tsx`, `TornadoChart.tsx`, `ValuationSummaryCard.tsx`.
- **Hooks**: `useValuation(dealId)`, `useScenarioManager`, `useMonteCarloSimulation` (mocked for deterministic test outputs).
- **State**: React Query queries/mutations with optimistic updates; fallback skeleton loaders for each tab.
- **Exports**: Client triggers backend export endpoints; downloads handled via signed URLs.
- **Design**: Tailwind CSS + component patterns aligned with dashboard aesthetic, accessible keyboard navigation.

### Data Flow (High Level)
1. User selects deal ‚Üí `ValuationSuite.tsx` fetches valuation summary.
2. DCF tab: inputs persisted via PATCH endpoint, calculations recomputed server-side, UI reflects results.
3. Comparables tab: user adds comps (manual or CSV upload) ‚Üí backend normalizes, returns implied valuation.
4. Precedents tab: list + analytics similar to comparables.
5. Scenarios tab: create/edit scenario ‚Üí backend recalculates valuations with scenario overrides.
6. Exports tab: user generates PDF/Excel ‚Üí background task completes ‚Üí document added to data room.
