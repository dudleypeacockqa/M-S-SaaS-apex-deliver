# Story: Expand Protected Routing & Feature Areas

**Story ID**: DEV-003  
**Status**: Ready to Start  
**Related PRD Sections**: 3.1 User & Organization Management, 3.2 Deal Flow & Pipeline Management  
**Related Technical Spec Sections**: 2.1 Frontend Architecture, 4.3 Authentication & Authorization

---

## Problem Statement

With core authentication in place (DEV-002), the remaining feature areas still allow direct access without guardrails. Deals and admin surfaces need explicit `SignedIn`/`SignedOut` handling, loading feedback, and role awareness before RBAC work can proceed.

---

## Goals

1. Introduce a reusable protected-route primitive that can apply loading, redirect, and role checks.
2. Gate `/dashboard/*`, `/deals/*`, and `/admin/*` with the new guard.
3. Provide shared navigation and breadcrumbs across protected routes.
4. Cover the flow with Vitest suites (unit + integration) using Clerk mocks.

---

## Deliverables

- `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- `src/layouts/ProtectedLayout.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/NavigationMenu.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/Breadcrumbs.tsx`
- Route scaffolds for dashboard, deals, and admin areas
- Vitest coverage for redirects, role enforcement, navigation, and breadcrumbs

---

## Test Plan (Draft)

- `ProtectedRoute.test.tsx`: redirects visitors, allows authenticated access, handles role mismatches.
- `NavigationMenu.test.tsx`: hides admin links for non-admin roles, marks the active route.
- `Breadcrumbs.test.tsx`: builds readable paths for nested routes.
- `tests/integration/routing.test.tsx`: end-to-end navigation across public and protected areas.

---

## Status Notes

- DEV-002 finalised the shared `RootLayout`, base routing, and authentication tests.
- Clerk mocks are centralised in the existing test helpers.
- No code for DEV-003 has been merged yet; this story is queued next.

---

## Next Steps

1. Finalise the TDD harness (fill in TBD asserts inside scaffolded tests).
2. Implement the guard + layout pieces iteratively, keeping tests green.
3. Update documentation and BMAD tracker once routes are protected.
