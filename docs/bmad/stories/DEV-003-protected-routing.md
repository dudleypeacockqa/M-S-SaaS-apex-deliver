# Story: Expand Protected Routing & Feature Areas

**Story ID**: DEV-003  
**Status**: Complete  
**Related PRD Sections**: 3.1 User & Organization Management, 3.2 Deal Flow & Pipeline Management, 4.1 Master Admin Portal  
**Related Technical Spec Sections**: 2.1 Frontend Architecture, 4.3 Authentication & Authorization

## Problem Statement
The Vite/React frontend already authenticated users via Clerk, but core feature areas (dashboard, deal pipeline, admin portal) were still rendered through a single unprotected shell. Navigation links were static, breadcrumbs absent, and unauthenticated visitors could hit deep links without a clear redirect path. Admin-only surfaces lacked guardrails which blocked RBAC work.

## Implementation Summary
- Introduced a reusable `<ProtectedRoute>` wrapper that checks Clerk auth state, shows a loading spinner, redirects unauthenticated users to `/sign-in`, and enforces role-based access (`admin` guard for admin routes).
- Added `<ProtectedLayout>` which wraps protected sections with the new role-aware `<NavigationMenu>` and hierarchical `<Breadcrumbs>` component.
- Built out dashboard, deals, and admin page placeholders (overview/profile/subscription/settings, pipeline/new/details/documents, admin dashboard/users/organizations/analytics) so every major route renders meaningful scaffolding.
- Implemented an accessible landing page, custom sign-in surface, and `/unauthorized` page for failed role checks; navigation links now carry `aria-current="page"` to support keyboard users.
- Hardened Clerk mocks across unit and integration tests to keep vitest deterministic (stubbing `getToken`, providing SignedIn/SignedOut fallbacks, etc.).

## Deliverables
- `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` (role-aware guard)  
- `src/components/auth/AuthErrorBoundary.tsx`, `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner.tsx`  
- `src/components/layout/NavigationMenu.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Breadcrumbs.tsx`  
- `src/layouts/ProtectedLayout.tsx` / `PublicLayout`  
- Dashboard/deals/admin page sets under `src/pages/...` plus `src/pages/UnauthorizedPage.tsx`  
- Router refactor in `src/App.tsx` exporting reusable `AppRoutes`

## Testing
Following TDD, tests were written/updated before implementation. Final vitest run:

```
npm test
```

Results: **43/43** tests passing (unit + integration). Key suites:
- `ProtectedRoute.test.tsx` – redirect, spinner, role enforcement
- `NavigationMenu.test.tsx` – role-based visibility & aria-current handling
- `Breadcrumbs.test.tsx` – dynamic breadcrumb generation & slug formatting
- `App.test.tsx` / `tests/integration/routing.test.tsx` – end-to-end navigation and redirects

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All protected feature routes require authentication; unauthenticated visitors are redirected to `/sign-in`
- [x] Navigation menu shows appropriate links based on user role; admin portal only visible to `admin`
- [x] Breadcrumbs display correct navigation paths for top-level and nested routes
- [x] Loading spinner presented while Clerk auth state is resolving
- [x] Auth error boundary surfaces authentication errors gracefully
- [x] Integration tests confirm redirects and unauthorized handling

## Follow-Up
- DEV-005 (RBAC) can now consume the stored user roles to hide/disable component-level functionality.
- DEV-006 (deal pipeline Kanban) can drop into the protected `/deals/pipeline` shell with DnD features.
- Once backend `/api/auth/me` is live, hook `useCurrentUser` into the layout for richer header context.

## Evidence
- Vitest: `43 passed, 0 failed`  
- Screenshots/recordings: see QA artifact bundle `artifacts/dev-003-routing/` (uploaded to shared drive)  
- Story status updated in BMAD tracker and progress log.
