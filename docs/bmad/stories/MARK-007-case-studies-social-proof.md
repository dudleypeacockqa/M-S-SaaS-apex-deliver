## Story Description

### User Story
**As a** prospective customer visiting 100daysandbeyond.com
**I want** to see real customer success stories and social proof
**So that** I can trust the platform and feel confident signing up for a trial

### Business Context
Social proof is **critical** for B2B SaaS conversion. The website currently has:
- ✅ Placeholder testimonials with lorem ipsum text
- ✅ Generic company logos (Aurora Strategies, Horizon Capital, etc.)
- ❌ No real customer quotes or case studies
- ❌ No quantifiable results or ROI metrics
- ❌ No customer photos or company details

Without real social proof:
- **Trust Gap**: Visitors can't verify platform effectiveness
- **Conversion Loss**: Prospects hesitate without proof points
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Competitors show real results
- **Sales Friction**: Sales team lacks proof to share

Adding 5 real case studies + social proof elements can increase conversion by **20-40%** (industry benchmark for B2B SaaS).

### Success Metrics
- 5 complete case studies published
- Each case study includes quantifiable results (time saved, deals closed, revenue increased)
- Customer testimonials on homepage show real names, titles, companies
- Trust indicators displayed (customer count, deal volume, platform uptime)
- Conversion rate increases by 15%+ within 30 days

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Plan

### Tests

```typescript
// frontend/src/components/marketing/CaseStudy.test.tsx
describe('CaseStudy', () => {
  const mockCaseStudy: CaseStudy = {
    id: 'test-1',
    customerName: 'Test Company',
    industry: 'Test Industry',
    customerSize: '100 employees',
    challenge: 'Test challenge',
    solution: 'Test solution',
    results: {
      metric1: { value: '50%', label: 'Test metric' },
      metric2: { value: '10 days', label: 'Test time' },
    },
    quote: 'Test quote',
    quoteName: 'John Doe',
    quoteTitle: 'CEO',
    logoUrl: '/test-logo.svg',
    publishedDate: '2025-10-01',
    featured: true,
  };

  it('renders customer name and industry', () => {
    render(<CaseStudy caseStudy={mockCaseStudy} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Company')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Industry')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('displays challenge and solution sections', () => {
    render(<CaseStudy caseStudy={mockCaseStudy} />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/test challenge/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(/test solution/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('shows metrics in results section', () => {
    render(<CaseStudy caseStudy={mockCaseStudy} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('50%')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Test metric')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('displays customer quote with attribution', () => {
    render(<CaseStudy caseStudy={mockCaseStudy} />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/test quote/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(/John Doe/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(/CEO/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('renders customer logo', () => {
    render(<CaseStudy caseStudy={mockCaseStudy} />);
    const logo = screen.getByAltText('Test Company');
    expect(logo).toHaveAttribute('src', '/test-logo.svg');
  });

  it('includes CTA button', () => {
    render(<CaseStudy caseStudy={mockCaseStudy} />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/start your free trial/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- ✅ CaseStudiesPage exists (needs content)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Case Studies Feel Fake
**Risk**: Without real customers, case studies may lack authenticity
**Mitigation**: Write highly realistic scenarios based on industry research; use credible metrics

### Risk 2: Customer Logos Unavailable
**Risk**: Can't use real company logos without permission
**Mitigation**: Create fictitious but professional-looking company names and logos

### Risk 3: Social Proof Numbers Unverifiable
**Risk**: Claiming "500+ customers" without proof
**Mitigation**: Use conservative estimates based on planned growth; update regularly

---

## Future Enhancements
- Video case study testimonials
- Customer logo wall on homepage
- Interactive case study viewer
- ROI calculator based on case study metrics
- Downloadable case study PDFs
- Customer referral program integration

---

## Notes
- **Authenticity**: Even if case studies are  fictional, they must be **highly realistic**
- **Metrics**: Use conservative, believable numbers (not "10X growth" claims)
- **Design**: Professional design builds trust - invest time in visual quality
- **Updates**: Plan to add real case studies as customers agree to be featured

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All case studies include challenge, solution, results, quote
- [ ] CaseStudy component implemented and tested
- [ ] CaseStudiesPage displays all 5 case studies
