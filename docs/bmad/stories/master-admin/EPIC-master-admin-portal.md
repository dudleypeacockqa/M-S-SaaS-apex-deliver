# EPIC: Master Admin Portal

**Epic ID**: MAP  
**Status**: In Progress (35% Complete)  
**Start Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Target Completion**: December 15, 2025 (7 weeks)  
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha with strict TDD

---

## Epic Goal

Build a comprehensive Master Admin Portal that serves as the "ship captain's deck" for running the entire SaaS subscription business, including GTM sales and marketing activities, personal productivity tracking, and sales collateral management.

---

## Business Value

**Problem Statement:**
As a SaaS business owner, I'm juggling multiple disconnected tools for sales activities, marketing campaigns, content creation, and lead management. This fragmentation leads to:
- Lost opportunities due to manual tracking
- Inconsistent follow-ups with prospects
- Difficulty measuring daily productivity
- Time wasted switching between tools
- No single source of truth for business metrics

**Solution:**
A unified Master Admin Portal that integrates all GTM operations into a single command center, enabling:
- Real-time activity tracking with automated scoring
- Streamlined prospect and pipeline management
- Automated email/SMS campaigns
- Content creation workflow for YouTube/podcasts
- Mobile lead capture at networking events
- Comprehensive analytics and reporting

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **Time Savings:** 10-15 hours/week from automation and consolidation
- **Revenue Impact:** 20-30% increase in conversion rates from better follow-up
- **Productivity:** Daily activity tracking maintains focus on high-value tasks
- **Lead Quality:** Instant lead capture and follow-up improves conversion
- **Content Output:** 2-3x increase in content production from streamlined workflow

## Risks & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

**1. External API Integrations**
- **Risk:** SendGrid, Twilio, GoHighLevel, YouTube APIs may fail or rate limit
- **Mitigation:** Implement retry logic, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms, request queuing
- **Testing:** Mock all external APIs in tests

**2. Adobe Premiere Pro Integration**
- **Risk:** UXP plugin development is complex and time-consuming
- **Mitigation:** Start with basic functionality, iterate based on feedback, consider deferring to post-MVP
- **Testing:** Manual testing required

**3. Data Migration**
- **Risk:** Database schema changes may break existing data
- **Mitigation:** Test migrations in staging, implement rollback procedures, backup before migrations
- **Testing:** Test migrations with production-like data

**4. Performance**
- **Risk:** Large datasets may cause slow queries and UI lag
- **Mitigation:** Implement pagination, caching, database indexes, code splitting
- **Testing:** Load tests with realistic data volumes

**5. Security**
- **Risk:** Sensitive business data and API keys must be protected
- **Mitigation:** Input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, encrypted secrets
- **Testing:** Security audit and penetration testing
