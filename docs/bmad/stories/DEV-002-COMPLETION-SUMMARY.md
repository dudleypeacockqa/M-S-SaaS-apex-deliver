# DEV-002 – Frontend Authentication Completion Summary

**Story ID**: DEV-002  
**Status**: Completed  
**Completed**: October 24, 2025  
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha with strict TDD

---

## Overview

The frontend now relies on Clerk for authentication. The application bootstraps inside `ClerkProvider`, public and private routes are defined with React Router, and the shared layout surfaces the appropriate SignedIn/SignedOut actions. Dashboard access is limited to authenticated users, while visitors see the home and sign-in surfaces.

---

## Key Deliverables

- `frontend/src/main.tsx` – wraps the React tree with `ClerkProvider` and validates `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
- `frontend/src/layouts/RootLayout.tsx` – shared layout with navigation plus SignedIn/SignedOut header treatments.
- `frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` – public landing content with calls to action.
- `frontend/src/pages/SignInPage.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/SignUpPage.tsx` – Clerk-powered entry points.
- `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` – protected dashboard scaffold for signed-in users.
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` – centralises routes and wraps `/dashboard` in Clerk `SignedIn` / `SignedOut` logic.

---

## Testing

Vitest suites were written/updated before implementation:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

Key assertions cover unauthenticated redirects, dashboard rendering for signed-in users, and header state changes driven by Clerk.

All tests passing (29 in total).

---

## Follow-Up

1. **DEV-003 – Protected Routing Expansion**: extend the dashboard guard pattern to deals and admin sections.
2. **DEV-004 – Backend Clerk Session Sync**: expose `/api/auth/me` so the frontend can hydrate user context from the API.
3. **DEV-005 – RBAC**: build on Clerk metadata to gate component-level behaviour.

## Evidence

- Commit history and current working tree (see `git status`).
- Vitest run: `29 passed, 0 failed`.
- Updated BMAD tracker documenting progress.
