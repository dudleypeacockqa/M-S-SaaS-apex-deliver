# Story: Backend Clerk Session Synchronization

**Story ID**: DEV-004  
**Status**: Complete  
**Related PRD Sections**: 3.1 User & Organization Management, 6.1 Architecture & Stack, 6.2 Security  
**Related Technical Spec Sections**: 2.2 Backend Services, 4.3 Authentication & Authorization, 5.2 Security Controls

## Problem Statement
Frontend authentication is operational via Clerk, but the FastAPI backend previously had no awareness of Clerk users, sessions, or JWTs. Without a synchronized user store or server-side token verification, protected API endpoints could not validate requests, making downstream services and RBAC impossible.

## Objectives
- Register Clerk webhook endpoints so user/session lifecycle events persist to the platform database.
- Expose a dependable service layer for Clerk user data (create/update/delete/lookups).
- Provide a FastAPI dependency that validates Clerk JWTs and injects the corresponding user context.
- Ensure webhook signatures are verified before processing payloads.
- Cover the new authentication surface with deterministic pytest suites.

## Implementation Notes
- Leveraged `python-jose` with the configured `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` to validate HS256 Clerk tokens used in staging.
- Lightweight HMAC verification is applied to webhook payloads; malformed or unsigned requests return 400/500 responses.
- Persisted Clerk attributes (role, profile image, timestamps, last login, soft-delete) on the SQLAlchemy `User` model.
- Added `/api/auth/me` route to demonstrate dependency injection and response serialization via Pydantic schemas.
- Tests override the database session with SQLite and operate entirely offline.

## Deliverables
- SQLAlchemy `User` model & Pydantic schemas (`backend/app/models/user.py`, `backend/app/schemas/user.py`).
- Database session helpers (`backend/app/db/base.py`, `backend/app/db/session.py`).
- Clerk webhook router with signature validation (`backend/app/api/webhooks/clerk.py`).
- Authentication dependency & security utilities (`backend/app/api/dependencies/auth.py`, `backend/app/core/security.py`).
- User service encapsulating CRUD/webhook operations (`backend/app/services/user_service.py`).
- Auth route returning the active user (`backend/app/api/routes/auth.py`).
- Updated FastAPI application wiring (`backend/app/api/__init__.py`, `backend/app/main.py`).
- Passing backend test suite (`python -m pytest` → 20 tests, all green).

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Missing webhook fields could crash the endpoint.  
  **Mitigation**: Guard clauses return controlled errors when required keys are absent.
- **Risk**: JWT or webhook secrets unset in a new environment.  
  **Mitigation**: Added configuration fields (`database_url`, `clerk_secret_key`, `clerk_webhook_secret`, `clerk_jwt_algorithm`) and warnings surfaced through the health endpoint/tests.
- **Risk**: Session timestamps can arrive malformed.  
  **Mitigation**: Parser tolerates invalid formats without raising.

## Next Steps After Completion
- DEV-005: Implement RBAC and feature gating using stored `UserRole` values.
- Align backend API endpoints (deals, admin, etc.) with the new `get_current_user` dependency.

## Evidence
- `python -m pytest` (backend) → 20 passed, 0 failed.
- Webhook + auth regression coverage captured in `tests/test_clerk_auth_complete.py`.
