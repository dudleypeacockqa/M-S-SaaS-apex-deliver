## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Guidelines

### Testing Pyramid

```
         /\
        /E2E\         <- 10% (Critical user journeys)
       /------\
      /  INT   \      <- 30% (API integration tests)
     /----------\
    /   UNIT     \    <- 60% (Pure functions, utilities)
   /--------------\
```

### Test Coverage Targets

- **Unit Tests:** 80% coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests:** All API endpoints
- **E2E Tests:** 5-10 critical user flows

### Testing Tools

- **Unit Tests:** Vitest
- **Integration Tests:** Vitest + Supertest
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright
- **API Mocking:** MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- **Test Database:** SQLite in-memory

### TDD Workflow

1. **Red:** Write a failing test
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor:** Improve code quality
4. **Repeat:** Next feature

---

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

1. **External API Integrations:**
   - **Risk:** SendGrid, Twilio, GoHighLevel, YouTube APIs may fail
   - **Mitigation:** Implement retry logic, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms
   - **Testing:** Mock all external APIs in tests

2. **Adobe Premiere Pro Integration:**
   - **Risk:** UXP plugin development is complex
   - **Mitigation:** Start with basic functionality, iterate based on feedback
   - **Testing:** Manual testing required (no automated tests possible)

3. **Real-time Features:**
   - **Risk:** WebSocket connections may be unstable
   - **Mitigation:** Implement reconnection logic, offline support
   - **Testing:** Test reconnection scenarios

4. **Data Migration:**
   - **Risk:** Database schema changes may break existing data
   - **Mitigation:** Test migrations in staging, implement rollback procedures
   - **Testing:** Test migrations with production-like data

### Mitigation Strategies

- **API Rate Limits:** Implement caching, request queuing
- **Data Loss:** Implement auto-save, optimistic updates with rollback
- **Security:** Input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection
- **Performance:** Code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization
