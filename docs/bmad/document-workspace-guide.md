# Document Workspace Guide

Use this guide when managing secure workspaces for diligence and investor sharing.

## 1. Folder Strategy
- Mirror your diligence index (e.g., 1. Corporate, 2. Financial, 3. Legal).
- Remember: permissions cascade. If a user only needs Legal, share the Legal folder explicitly before uploading.

## 2. Upload & Audit
- Upload in small batches using the Upload Panel to keep audit logs manageable.
- Monitor the toast notifications for progress; download the audit log after major deliveries.

## 3. Bulk Actions
- Use **Bulk Move** only after confirming the target folder’s permissions.
- Archive files in batches after export to maintain a clean workspace.
- Bulk share links should expire after investor reviews.

## 4. FAQs
- **Where are audit logs?** Use the "Access Log" button in the Document List or the new help tooltip.
- **How do I answer vendor questions?** Open the Questions panel for each document and assign owners.
