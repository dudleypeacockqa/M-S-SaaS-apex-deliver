**Last Updated:** 2025-11-19  
**Related Docs:** `docs/implementation_report_2025_11_19.md` (Section 4 – Core Modules) and `docs/bmad/BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`

## 1. Locate the Community Feed
- Navigate to **Community** from the enterprise sidebar.
- Use the upcoming in-app help icon near the filters for quick tips (will be added alongside feature tours).

## 2. Moderation Checklist
1. Review new posts and comments daily.
2. Remove spam or off-topic content via the delete action on each post card.
3. Use the reaction controls to elevate helpful insights.
4. Log key decisions in the operations notes so support has an audit trail.

## 3. FAQ
- **Where do I see reports?** A dedicated moderation queue will live under `/community/reports` (Phase 8 scope).
- **How are users notified?** Authors receive automatic email notifications when their posts are removed.

## 4. Next Steps & Escalation
- Integrate this guide into the in-app help center (HelpTooltip rollout tracked in the UI backlog).
- Record short Loom walk-throughs for onboarding new moderators.
- Escalate policy questions or tooling gaps via the Master Admin portal → **Operations → Community** so decisions are logged per BMAD governance.
