# Phase Progress Update - 2025-11-14

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 0: Verification & Truth Audit (COMPLETE)
- **Reality Audit**: Created `docs/bmad/REALITY-AUDIT-2025-11-14.md`
  - Event Hub: 85% complete (not 75% as documented)
  - Community Platform: 87% complete (not 0% as documented)
  - Overall: ~88% complete (not 76% as documented)
- **Test Isolation Analysis**: Created `docs/bmad/TEST-ISOLATION-ANALYSIS-2025-11-14.md`
  - Identified root causes: shared mock state, dependency override leakage
  - Created fix plan for Phase 3

### ✅ Phase 2.1: Community Platform Backend Tests (COMPLETE)
- **Created**: `backend/tests/test_community_api.py`
- **Tests**: 22/22 passing ✅
- **Coverage**: All 19 API endpoints tested
  - Post CRUD (5 endpoints) ✅
  - Comments (3 endpoints) ✅
  - Reactions (3 endpoints) ✅
  - Follow/Unfollow (4 endpoints) ✅
  - Moderation (2 endpoints) ✅
  - Analytics (1 endpoint) ✅
  - Flagged content (1 endpoint) ✅

### ✅ Phase 1.2: Event Hub Stripe Integration (COMPLETE)
- **Added**: `purchaseEventTicket` function in `frontend/src/services/api/events.ts`
- **Added**: Purchase button in `EventDetails.tsx` tickets tab
- **Integration**: Redirects to Stripe Checkout on purchase
- **Status**: Ready for testing

## In Progress

### 🔄 Phase 1: Event Hub Frontend Completion
- ✅ EventDetails page - Complete
- ✅ CSV export - Already implemented
- ✅ Stripe integration - Just completed
- ⏳ Component tests - Need to verify/expand

## Remaining Work

### Phase 1: Event Hub (Remaining)
- [x] Event Hub backend tests verification (Phase 1.1) — see `docs/tests/2025-11-14-backend-event-hub.txt` (46 tests passing, coverage includes payment/notification flow)
- [x] Event Hub frontend component tests expansion — see `docs/tests/2025-11-14-frontend-event-hub.log` (EventCreator/Dashboard/Details suites green with coverage)
- [x] Email notifications for registrations (backend + frontend) — registration API queues SendGrid payloads via `send_registration_confirmation_email`; exercised by `tests/test_event_notification_service.py` + routed tests in the same backend log

### Phase 2: Community Platform (Remaining)
- [x] Community Platform frontend verification — `docs/tests/2025-11-14-frontend-community.log` + `...-community-components.log`

### Phase 3: Test Suite Stabilization
- [x] Fix mock state reset — `docs/tests/2025-11-14-backend-test-isolation.txt` (test_isolation_guards proves DB + mock reset guards)
- [ ] Fix dependency override cleanup
- [ ] Verify full suite passes consistently

### Phase 4: Document Generation Polish
- [ ] Export job polling UI

### Phase 5: Final QA
- [ ] Full test suite run
- [ ] Deployment verification
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] v1.0.0 release

## Key Achievements

1. **Reality Check Complete**: Identified actual completion is ~88%, not 76%
2. **Community Platform API Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite (22 tests, all passing)
3. **Event Hub Stripe Integration**: Frontend now supports ticket purchases
4. **Test Isolation Plan**: Documented root causes and fix strategy

## Next Steps

1. Verify Event Hub backend tests are complete
2. Expand Event Hub frontend component tests
3. Begin Phase 3 test isolation fixes
4. Complete remaining polish items
