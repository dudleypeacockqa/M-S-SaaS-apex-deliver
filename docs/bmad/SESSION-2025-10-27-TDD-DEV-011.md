# BMAD Session Report: DEV-011 Multi-Method Valuation Suite

**Session Date**: October 27, 2025 12:50 UTC
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha + Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Objective**: Establish baseline for DEV-011 and transition from planning to RED phase
**Status**: 🟡 Planning complete → RED phase initiation

---

## 🎯 Session Objectives
1. Capture current repository and deployment status before DEV-011 implementation
2. Align BMAD tracker and session documentation with Sprint 5 kickoff
3. Outline immediate RED-phase tasks for backend valuation domain

---

## 📊 Baseline Snapshot (2025-10-27 12:50 UTC)
- **Git**: branch `main`; working tree dirty with staged valuation service/unit tests plus untracked frontend valuation files (RED assets)
- **Remote**: `origin/main` in sync with latest commit `25d187d docs(DEV-010): mark story as 100% complete with Sprint 4 summary`
- **Backend health**: `https://ma-saas-backend.onrender.com/health` → HTTP 200 OK (verified via curl)
- **Frontend health**: `https://apexdeliver.com` → HTTP 403 (requires follow-up during exports/ops step)
- **Tests**: DEV-011 suites not yet executed; prior DEV-010 baseline (Backend 74/74, Frontend 33/33) recorded for reference

---

## ✅ Actions Completed This Session
- Reviewed `docs/bmad/stories/DEV-011-valuation-suite.md` and synced plan with `dev.plan.md`
- Updated `docs/bmad/BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` with new timestamp, git/deployment status, and Sprint 5 RED-phase note
- Logged this session report to record baseline metrics before further TDD work

---

## 🧪 Immediate Next Steps
1. Finalize RED tests for valuation domain (DCF, comparables, precedents, scenarios, exports)
2. Design Alembic migration and model scaffolding to support valuation entities (to be added post-RED tests)
3. Prepare backend pytest command sequence to validate RED failures (`backend\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest backend/tests/test_valuation_service.py`)
