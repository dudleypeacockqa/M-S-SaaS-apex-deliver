# M&A Intelligence Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Author:** Dudley Peacock
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Project Level:** 4
**Target Scale:** Enterprise multi-tenant SaaS platform

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Deliver a single workspace where M&A teams can run sourcing, diligence, negotiation, and closing without leaving the platform.
- Embed AI copilots that turn raw deal data into valuations, ratios, and narratives that accelerate decision quality.
- Guarantee enterprise-grade trust with multi-tenant isolation, granular RBAC, auditable data rooms, and compliance-ready records.
- Build predictable revenue through tiered subscriptions, metered usage insights, and self-service upgrades.
- Activate community-led growth loops via content hubs, events, and professional networking features tied to the core product.
- Integrate seamlessly with core back-office stacks (accounting, CRM, comms) so workflows stay synchronized and automated.

### Background Context

The current solution already includes a production-grade FastAPI stack (`backend/app`) with domain modules for deals, documents, tasks, valuations, subscriptions, and automation. Endpoints such as `backend/app/api/routes/subscriptions.py`, `backend/app/api/routes/deals.py`, and `backend/app/api/routes/documents.py` sit on top of SQLAlchemy models (`backend/app/models`) and service layers (`backend/app/services`) that are covered by pytest suites (e.g., `backend/tests/test_valuation_service.py`, `backend/tests/test_task_automation.py`). The Vite/React frontend (`frontend/src`) ships authenticated workspaces, billing flows, marketing funnels, and valuation UI backed by shared hooks (`frontend/src/hooks/useValuation.ts`) and integration tests.

Execution history and market validation are documented across `docs/bmad/technical_specifications.md`, sprint and session summaries, and DEV-011/DEV-012 artefacts, all of which confirm demand for an integrated M&A operating system with AI-assisted intelligence. ApexDeliver is targeting 1,000 paying accounts and GBP 2M ARR within 12 months to bankroll a systematic LBO acquisition flywheel while reinvesting in continuous product expansion.

The platform must preserve the established architecture: multi-tenant PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy models, modular FastAPI services orchestrated via Celery tasks, a Stripe-first billing engine, and a Vite + Tailwind frontend. Compliance, auditability, and security remain non-negotiableâ€”SOC2/GDPR readiness, role-based isolation, traceable data-room workflows, and observability guardrails underpin every release.

## Out of Scope

- Building bespoke on-premise deployments or single-tenant forks (cloud multi-tenant only for this release cycle).
- Supporting non-M&A vertical workflows (e.g., general CRM, HRIS) beyond reusable platform capabilities.
- Developing native mobile apps; responsive web is required, mobile wrappers can follow later roadmap.
- Real-time voice transcription or live video conferencingâ€”integrate with existing vendors instead.
- Manual consulting services; the focus remains on SaaS delivery, with partners handling bespoke advisory work.
