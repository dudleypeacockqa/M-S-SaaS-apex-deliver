# M&A Intelligence Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Author:** Dudley Peacock
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Project Level:** 4
**Target Scale:** Enterprise multi-tenant SaaS platform

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Deliver a single workspace where M&A teams can run sourcing, diligence, negotiation, and closing without leaving the platform.
- Embed AI copilots that turn raw deal data into valuations, ratios, and narratives that accelerate decision quality.
- Guarantee enterprise-grade trust with multi-tenant isolation, granular RBAC, auditable data rooms, and compliance-ready records.
- Build predictable revenue through tiered subscriptions, metered usage insights, and self-service upgrades.
- Activate community-led growth loops via content hubs, events, and professional networking features tied to the core product.
- Integrate seamlessly with core back-office stacks (accounting, CRM, comms) so workflows stay synchronized and automated.

### Background Context

The current solution already includes a production-grade FastAPI stack (`backend/app`) with domain modules for deals, documents, tasks, valuations, subscriptions, and automation. Endpoints such as `backend/app/api/routes/subscriptions.py`, `backend/app/api/routes/deals.py`, and `backend/app/api/routes/documents.py` sit on top of SQLAlchemy models (`backend/app/models`) and service layers (`backend/app/services`) that are covered by pytest suites (e.g., `backend/tests/test_valuation_service.py`, `backend/tests/test_task_automation.py`). The Vite/React frontend (`frontend/src`) ships authenticated workspaces, billing flows, marketing funnels, and valuation UI backed by shared hooks (`frontend/src/hooks/useValuation.ts`) and integration tests.

Execution history and market validation are documented across `docs/bmad/technical_specifications.md`, sprint and session summaries, and DEV-011/DEV-012 artefacts, all of which confirm demand for an integrated M&A operating system with AI-assisted intelligence. ApexDeliver is targeting 1,000 paying accounts and GBP 2M ARR within 12 months to bankroll a systematic LBO acquisition flywheel while reinvesting in continuous product expansion.

The platform must preserve the established architecture: multi-tenant PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy models, modular FastAPI services orchestrated via Celery tasks, a Stripe-first billing engine, and a Vite + Tailwind frontend. Compliance, auditability, and security remain non-negotiable—SOC2/GDPR readiness, role-based isolation, traceable data-room workflows, and observability guardrails underpin every release.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Identity & Access Management**: Enforce Clerk-backed auth, organization isolation, role-based permissions (Owner/Admin/Member/Read-only), and full audit logs for every privileged action.
- **Deal Lifecycle Management**: Provide configurable pipelines (Kanban, list views), custom stages/fields, deal linking to contacts/assets, and automation triggers when stage changes occur.
- **Secure Data Rooms**: Offer deal-scoped folders with watermarking, download controls, immutable access history, NDA acceptance, Q&A workflows, and granular guest access policies.
- **Financial Intelligence Suite**: Import accounting data, compute 47+ ratios, scenario projections, and valuations (DCF, Comparables, Precedents), plus narrative insights and exportable reports.
- **Task & Workflow Automation**: Generate task templates and recurring checklists, surface workload dashboards, and execute rule-based automations with logs and retry safeguards.
- **Subscription & Billing**: Manage tier entitlements, seat quotas, add-ons, invoicing, proration, refunds, and self-service upgrades/downgrades synchronized with Stripe webhooks.
- **AI Copilots & Content Generation**: Deliver prompt-safe AI services for document drafting, insight summaries, and deal matching with provider failover, cost tracking, and human review controls.
- **Community & Growth Modules**: Enable content hubs, events, podcast studio bookings, and professional networking spaces with moderation tools and revenue-sharing capabilities.
- **Integration Layer**: Sync with accounting (Xero, QuickBooks, Sage, NetSuite), CRM, communication, and marketing systems via secure OAuth connectors, webhook verification, and retry queues.
- **Administration & Support**: Provide a Master Admin Portal for tenant oversight, health analytics, feature toggles, support case handling, and platform-wide broadcast messaging.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Surface dashboards for pipeline performance, subscription metrics, AI usage, task compliance, and provide export APIs for BI tooling.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Reliability & Availability**: 99.95% uptime SLO, multi-region failover plan, automated backups (15-minute RPO) with quarterly recovery drills.
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms P95 API latency for core deal operations, data-room downloads streaming within 3 seconds, and web vitals LCP <2.5s on enterprise datasets.
- **Security & Compliance**: SOC2 Type II roadmap, GDPR/UK Data Protection alignment, field-level encryption for sensitive records, and continuous vulnerability scanning.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for FastAPI workers, async task processing via Celery/Redis, CDN-backed asset delivery, and tenant-aware sharding strategy as ARR grows.
- **Observability**: Centralized logging with structured events, OpenTelemetry tracing, AI usage dashboards, and automated anomaly alerts for billing or log-in spikes.
- **Data Governance**: Immutable audit trails for financial transactions and document access, configurable retention policies, and right-to-be-forgotten workflows.
- **Supportability**: Feature flags for progressive rollout, environment parity enforced via CI pipelines, and blue/green deployment playbooks captured in release docs.
- **Accessibility & UX**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard-first navigation for key workflows, localization readiness, and consistent design tokens across web properties.

## User Journeys

1. **Solo Dealmaker Onboarding & Deal Execution**
   - Signs up, creates an organization, invites a collaborator, and configures a lean pipeline.
   - Imports historical deals via CSV, spins up a secure data room, and shares documents with buyers.
   - Runs AI-assisted financial analysis, generates a valuation memo, and sends automated updates to stakeholders.

2. **Growth Firm Collaboration Loop**
   - Analyst logs into shared workspace, reviews task queue generated from due diligence checklist.
   - Team members co-author deal notes, respond to Q&A requests in the data room, and track blockers via dashboards.
   - Weekly review meeting leverages pipeline analytics and valuation snapshots exported to PDF.

3. **Enterprise Admin Governance**
   - Platform admin monitors subscription usage, seat allocations, and compliance warnings from the Master Admin Portal.
   - Initiates bulk role updates, audits access logs, and enforces watermarking policies ahead of a high-profile transaction.
   - Coordinates with finance to reconcile invoices and pushes webhook events into downstream ERP systems.

4. **Community Leader Engagement Flywheel**
   - Host creates a premium event, markets it via landing page modules, and sells tickets tied to Stripe subscriptions.
   - Captures recordings in the podcast studio, publishes gated content, and nurtures leads into higher subscription tiers.

## Out of Scope

- Building bespoke on-premise deployments or single-tenant forks (cloud multi-tenant only for this release cycle).
- Supporting non-M&A vertical workflows (e.g., general CRM, HRIS) beyond reusable platform capabilities.
- Developing native mobile apps; responsive web is required, mobile wrappers can follow later roadmap.
- Real-time voice transcription or live video conferencing—integrate with existing vendors instead.
- Manual consulting services; the focus remains on SaaS delivery, with partners handling bespoke advisory work.
