## 🚧 In Progress Stories

### QA-002: Frontend Routing Regression Triage
**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: Critical
**Opened**: October 24, 2025
**Closed**: October 24, 2025

**Summary**: Vitest regressions for protected routing resolved by updating Clerk test doubles, primary navigation labelling, and breadcrumb data for pipeline routes.

**Resolution Highlights**:
- Clerk mocks now respect sign-in state and expose SignIn/SignUp placeholders needed in vitest suites.
- AppLayout primary navigation carries an aria-label and breadcrumb config includes the Deals crumb expected by tests.
- Vitest suite passing (21/21) after npm run test -- --run at 10:16 BST on Oct 24 2025.

**Next Monitoring Steps**:
1. Re-run vitest after any navigation or breadcrumb change.
2. Reference QA-002 story for future protected-routing regressions.

### DEV-004: Backend Clerk Session Synchronization ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: High
**Completed**: October 24, 2025
**Duration**: ~3 hours

**Objective**: Expose Clerk session data to FastAPI backend, enabling server-side authentication verification and user context.

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Backend dependency alignment for Clerk SDK (httpx 0.27.0, pydantic 2.8.2, requests 2.32.3, pytest-cov 4.1.0)
- [x] Clerk webhook endpoints in FastAPI (5 event types: user.created, user.updated, user.deleted, session.created, session.ended)
- [x] User model synchronized with Clerk (with role enum, soft delete, organization support)
- [x] JWT verification middleware (using clerk_jwt_algorithm from config)
- [x] Session validation on protected API routes (/api/auth/me endpoint)
- [x] User context available in all API handlers via get_current_user dependency
- [x] Webhook signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
- [x] Test coverage for auth middleware (20 tests, 100% pass rate)
- [x] Documentation for backend auth flow

**Test Coverage**: ✅ 100% (20/20 tests passing)

**Key Achievements**:
