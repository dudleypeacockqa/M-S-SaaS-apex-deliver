## 📝 Notes & Learnings

### What's Working Well
- ✅ BMAD methodology providing clear structure
- ✅ TDD catching issues early
- ✅ CODEX prompts accelerating development
- ✅ Clerk integration smooth and well-documented
- ✅ Render auto-deploy working perfectly

### Areas for Improvement
- Consider breaking larger stories into smaller chunks
- Add more granular test coverage metrics
- Document common patterns for reuse
- Create component library for consistency

### Technical Decisions
- **Authentication**: Clerk (handles both auth + subscription billing)
- **Payments**: Stripe (one-off payments for events, masterclasses)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 on Render (Frankfurt)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI
- **Testing**: Vitest (frontend), Pytest (backend)
