**CRITICAL SCOPE CHANGE**: 🚨 DEV-016 Podcast Studio redefined as subscription add-on feature

---

## CRITICAL SCOPE CHANGE: DEV-016 Podcast Studio (2025-10-28)

### Change Summary

**Original Scope**: Podcast Studio as master-admin-only feature for platform content creation

**Revised Scope**: Podcast Studio as **subscription-gated add-on feature** available to paying tenants based on Clerk subscription tier

### Business Rationale

- **New Revenue Stream**: Sell podcast studio as premium add-on to target market
- **Competitive Advantage**: StreamYard-quality features (or better) with YouTube integration
- **Multi-Tenant**: Each tenant gets fully functional podcast workspace if subscribed
- **Tiered Access**: Feature availability scales with subscription level

### Subscription Tier Matrix

| Tier | Price | Podcast Access | Episodes/Month | Key Features |
|------|-------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Starter** | £279/mo | ❌ None | - | Core M&A features only |
| **Professional** | £598/mo | ✅ Audio Only | 10 | Audio podcasts, basic transcription (Whisper) |
| **Premium** | £1,598/mo | ✅ Full Suite | Unlimited | Audio + video, YouTube auto-publish, AI transcription |
| **Enterprise** | £2,997/mo | ✅ Advanced | Unlimited | + StreamYard live streaming, multi-language, priority support |

### Technical Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (3-4 days)**
1. Clerk middleware for subscription tier validation
2. Feature entitlement service with tier checking
3. Quota enforcement service (episodes/month limits)
4. Database schema updates (usage tracking tables)

**Phase 2: Backend Services (4-5 days)**
1. Podcast service layer with tier validation
2. API endpoints with 403 responses for insufficient tiers
3. Whisper transcription service (Professional+)
4. YouTube integration service (Premium+)
5. Live streaming service (Enterprise only)
6. Background jobs with tier-aware limits

**Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (3-4 days)**
1. Feature gates and conditional rendering
2. Upgrade prompts and CTAs for locked features
3. Podcast studio UI with tier-specific features
4. Usage quota displays and warnings

**Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (2-3 days)**
1. Comprehensive tier-based testing (all tiers)
2. 403 response validation for locked features
3. Quota enforcement validation
4. End-to-end testing across subscription flows
5. Production deployment with feature flags

### TDD Approach (Mandatory)

```
RED: Write test for tier checking → FAIL
GREEN: Implement Clerk integration → PASS
REFACTOR: Optimize and document

RED: Write test for podcast service with tier validation → FAIL
GREEN: Implement service with gates → PASS
REFACTOR: Clean up logic

RED: Write API test with 403 for insufficient tier → FAIL
GREEN: Implement endpoint with entitlement check → PASS
REFACTOR: Standardize error responses

[Continue for all features...]
```

### Acceptance Criteria

**Must Have**:
- ✅ Clerk subscription tier fetching from organization metadata
- ✅ Feature entitlement service with tier mapping
- ✅ API middleware enforcing 403 for locked features
- ✅ Frontend feature gates hiding unavailable features
- ✅ Upgrade CTAs directing to billing/pricing
- ✅ Quota enforcement for Professional tier (10 episodes/month)
- ✅ Whisper transcription for Professional+ tiers
- ✅ YouTube auto-publish for Premium+ tiers
- ✅ Live streaming for Enterprise tier only
- ✅ 100% test coverage on tier validation logic
- ✅ Zero security bypass vulnerabilities

**Should Have**:
- ✅ Graceful degradation when Clerk API fails (deny by default)
- ✅ Caching layer for tier data (reduce Clerk API calls)
- ✅ Real-time quota usage display
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages guiding to upgrade

**Nice to Have**:
- ⏳ A/B testing for upgrade CTA effectiveness
- ⏳ Analytics tracking for feature lock encounters
- ⏳ Self-service tier upgrade flow (Stripe integration)

### Impact on Other Stories

- **DEV-009 (Billing)**: Already implemented; requires tier metadata sync with Clerk
- **DEV-017 (Events)**: May adopt same subscription gating pattern
- **DEV-018 (Community)**: May adopt same subscription gating pattern
- **MARK-002 (Marketing)**: Update pricing page to highlight podcast add-on value

### Timeline

- **Phase 1-4**: 13-19 days to 100% completion
- **Start Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Target Completion**: 2025-11-16 (worst case)
- **Target Completion**: 2025-11-10 (best case)

### Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Subscription bypass vulnerabilities | 🔴 Critical | Multi-layer enforcement (API, service, frontend); comprehensive 403 tests |
| Clerk API failures | 🟠 High | Caching, circuit breakers, graceful degradation with deny-by-default |
| Quota enforcement gaps | 🟡 Medium | Real-time tracking, database constraints, race condition prevention |
| YouTube API rate limits | 🟡 Medium | Queue uploads, retry with exponential backoff, monitor quotas |
| Live streaming complexity | 🟡 Medium | Phase Enterprise features last, leverage WebRTC libraries, extensive testing |

### Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: ≥90% on all tier validation logic
- **Security**: Zero bypass vulnerabilities (penetration tested)
- **Performance**: Tier checks <100ms, cached responses <10ms
- **UX**: Upgrade CTAs convert ≥5% of feature lock encounters
- **Business**: ≥30% of Professional+ subscribers activate podcast feature

1. **Build** – create features with tests first
2. **Measure** – capture metrics and coverage
3. **Analyse** – review, identify gaps
4. **Decide** – plan next steps based on data

### Test-Driven Development

- Write tests before implementation
- Keep tests green before refactors
- Target 100 % coverage on critical flows
- Refactor once tests pass

### Deployment Strategy

- Commit early and often
- Push to GitHub for version control
- Allow Render auto-deploy from `main`
- Monitor deployment health post-release
