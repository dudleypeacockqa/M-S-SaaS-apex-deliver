## 🚧 In Progress Stories

### QA-002: Frontend Routing Regression Triage
**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: Critical
**Opened**: October 24, 2025
**Closed**: October 24, 2025

**Summary**: Vitest regressions for protected routing resolved by updating Clerk test doubles, primary navigation labelling, and breadcrumb data for pipeline routes.

**Resolution Highlights**:
- Clerk mocks now respect sign-in state and expose SignIn/SignUp placeholders needed in vitest suites.
- AppLayout primary navigation carries an aria-label and breadcrumb config includes the Deals crumb expected by tests.
- Vitest suite passing (21/21) after npm run test -- --run at 10:16 BST on Oct 24 2025.

**Next Monitoring Steps**:
1. Re-run vitest after any navigation or breadcrumb change.
2. Reference QA-002 story for future protected-routing regressions.

**Completed**: October 24, 2025
**Duration**: ~3 hours

**Objective**: Expose Clerk session data to FastAPI backend, enabling server-side authentication verification and user context.

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Backend dependency alignment for Clerk SDK (httpx 0.27.0, pydantic 2.8.2, requests 2.32.3, pytest-cov 4.1.0)

### OPS-001: Render Deployment Fixes & Git Cleanup ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: Critical
**Completed**: October 24, 2025
**Duration**: ~2 hours

**Objective**: Resolve critical Render deployment failures blocking production and ensure clean git repository state.

**Problem Statement**:
- Backend deployment failing with `AttributeError: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'cors_origins'`
- Frontend build failing with 24 TypeScript compilation errors in test files
- Git repository had uncommitted changes and build artifacts

**Root Causes**:
1. **Backend**: Pydantic v2 field type mismatch - field declared as `list[str]` but receiving `str` from environment
2. **Frontend**: Test files included in TypeScript compilation with type errors
3. **Git**: Build artifacts (*.db, *.tsbuildinfo, test_results.txt) not in .gitignore

**Fixes Implemented**:
- [x] Backend: Changed `cors_origins` field type from `list[str]` to `str` with validator converting to list
- [x] Frontend: Added test file exclusions to tsconfig.json (`**/*.test.tsx`, `**/*.spec.tsx`)
- [x] Git: Updated .gitignore with build artifact patterns
- [x] Git: Deleted 7 untracked build artifacts
- [x] Git: Committed all changes and pushed to origin/main
- [x] Git: Deleted stale `chore/bulk-update` branch
- [x] Git: Verified clean working tree on main branch

**Test Coverage**:
- Backend local test: ✅ `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` successful
- Frontend local test: ✅ `npm run build` completed in 1.09s
- Git status: ✅ "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

**Deployment Status**:
- ✅ 2 commits pushed to origin/main (commits `05b0dfe`, `8203706`)
- ✅ Render auto-deploy triggered
- ✅ Repository clean and working only on main branch

**Key Learnings**:
- Pydantic v2 requires field type to match input type before validation runs
- Test files should be excluded from production TypeScript compilation
- Build artifacts must be gitignored to prevent repository pollution
- Always clear Python `__pycache__` after config changes

**Commits**:
- `05b0dfe` - feat(backend): complete Clerk authentication integration (DEV-004)
- `8203706` - chore: update .gitignore to exclude build and test artifacts

**Next Steps**: Ongoing Render health monitoring during DEV-003 rollout

---

### OPS-004: Platform Status Verification ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Priority**: High  
**Completed**: October 24, 2025 (12:22 UTC)  
**Duration**: ~0.5 hours

**Objective**: Confirm both Render services are healthy post-backend redeploy and document outstanding git actions.

**Verification Steps**:
- Render API reports backend deploy  (commit ) status  with .
- Render API reports frontend deploy  (commit ) status  with .
- Deploy logs show Uvicorn startup and repeated  responses for , concluding with “Upload succeeded” and “Your service is live 🎉”.

**Outstanding Follow-Up**:
- Push local commit  from a credentialed workstation to align git and Render deployments.

### DEV-005: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Clerk Claims
**Status**: Planned  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours

**Objective**: Implement role-based UI controls using Clerk claims, enabling different user experiences for Solo Dealmakers, Growth Firm Users, Enterprise Users, and Admins.

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Clerk custom claims configuration
- [ ] Role definitions (Solo, Growth, Enterprise, Admin)
- [ ] Frontend role-based component visibility
- [ ] Backend role-based endpoint protection
- [ ] Permission checking utilities
- [ ] Role assignment workflow
- [ ] Test coverage for all roles
- [ ] Documentation for RBAC system

**Dependencies**: DEV-002, DEV-004 (backend sync)

**CODEX Prompt**: See `docs/bmad/prompts/DEV-005-rbac-implementation.md`
