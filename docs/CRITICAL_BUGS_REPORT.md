# Critical Bugs Report - ApexDeliver Marketing Website
**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025
**Site:** https://100daysandbeyond.com  
**Status:** MAJOR FIXES DEPLOYED - AWAITING VERIFICATION

---

## üî¥ Critical Regressions (2025-10-30 QA Retest)

### R1. Blog content still inaccessible
- **Symptom:** `/blog` renders the empty state and `https://100daysandbeyond.com/api/blog/posts` returns the SPA shell; direct call to `https://ma-saas-backend.onrender.com/api/blog/posts` replies with `500 Internal Server Error`.
- **Impact:** Zero organic content exposure; SEO plan blocked.
- **Evidence:** Cypress/Playwright smoke + manual curl during 2025-10-30 audit.
- **TDD Gate:** Add Vitest contract test for the fetch hook and a Playwright regression against seeded posts before shipping fix.
- **Action:** Re-open ticket DEV-010; rebuild API + seeds, wire frontend to `VITE_API_URL`, add monitor.

### R2. Contact form submissions dropped *(frontend wired May 2026 ‚Äî notifications pending)*
- **Symptom:** `/contact` now posts to `/api/marketing/contact` via the shared API client; backend persists messages. Email/CRM notifications still stubbed.
- **Impact:** Leads flow into `contact_messages` table; ops still needs notification channel.
- **TDD Gate:** Vitest form test mocking the contact service + backend pytest for `/api/marketing/contact`.
- **Action:** Implement SendGrid/CRM background task before removing this from Critical list.

### R3. Newsletter opt-in fails silently
- **Symptom:** Exit intent + sticky CTA posts to `/api/marketing/subscribe`; Render responds with SPA HTML and `catch` logs error. UI shows success even on failure.
- **Impact:** Email list growth halted.
- **TDD Gate:** Hook unit test asserting error UI + backend pytest mocking ESP provider.
- **Action:** Deploy real subscription endpoint and surface error message.

### R4. Team imagery 404s
- **Symptom:** `/assets/team/*.jpg` resolves to SPA index, leaving blank portraits.
- **Impact:** Trust erosion on About/Team pages.
- **TDD Gate:** Vitest fallback avatar test + CI HEAD request check.
- **Action:** Publish assets to CDN or bundle locally.

### R5. Canonical/OG metadata still references legacy domains
- **Symptom:** SEO helpers still hardcode `apexdeliver.com` / `ma-saas-platform.onrender.com`; canonical + OG tags continue to point to legacy hosts.
- **Impact:** Duplicate indexing persists; social previews remain incorrect.
- **TDD Gate:** Metadata snapshot tests must assert host = `100daysandbeyond.com` (landing, pricing, features, about, contact, legal).
- **Action:** Centralize domain constant, refresh HTML shell + SEO helpers, rerun Lighthouse/Search Console crawl.
