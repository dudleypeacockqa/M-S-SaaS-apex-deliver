## ðŸš€ Launch Decision Rationale

### Why PATH A (Ship Now)?

**Context**: Backend has been stable in production for weeks, but some developer tests are incomplete.

**Decision Factors**:
1. **Backend Proven Stable**: Health endpoint 100% operational, no Sentry errors
2. **Time to Revenue**: Every day of delay = Â£140-185 lost revenue potential
3. **Tests Are Developer Tools**: They validate code quality, not runtime functionality
4. **Real Customers > Perfect Tests**: User feedback is more valuable than test coverage
5. **Pragmatic Shipping Philosophy**: Ship working software, iterate based on feedback

**Financial Impact of Delay**:
- 3-4 day test-fixing delay = ~Â£140-185 lost revenue
- Estimate: 5 customers Ã— Â£28-37/day average subscription value

**Risk Assessment**:
- Backend risk: **Very Low** (proven stable for weeks)
- Frontend risk: **Low** (needs static deployment only)
- Test coverage: 80%+ on critical paths
