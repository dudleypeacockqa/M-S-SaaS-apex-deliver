[22m[39mA suspended resource finished loading inside a test, but the event was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that resolves suspended data should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://react.dev/link/wrap-tests-with-act

[22m[39mAn update to MarketingNav inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://react.dev/link/wrap-tests-with-act

[31mThis error originated in "[1msrc/pages/events/__tests__/EventCreator.test.tsx[22m" test file. It doesn't mean the error was thrown inside the file itself, but while it was running.[39m
[31mThe latest test that might've caused the error is "[1mshould handle API errors gracefully[22m". It might mean one of the following:
- The error was thrown, while Vitest was running this test.
- If the error occurred after the test had been completed, this was the last documented test before it was thrown.[39m
