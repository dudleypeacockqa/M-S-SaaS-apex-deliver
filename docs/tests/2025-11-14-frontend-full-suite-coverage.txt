stderr | src/components/marketing/MarketingNav.test.tsx > MarketingNav > supports keyboard navigation for desktop dropdowns
An update to MarketingNav inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://react.dev/link/wrap-tests-with-act
