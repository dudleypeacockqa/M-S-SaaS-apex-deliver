2025-11-13 – Vitest full-suite w/ coverage execution attempts (Phase 0 Task P0.1)
==========================================================================
Command: npm run test -- --run --coverage --pool=threads
Environment: Windows shell via Codex CLI (single-thread pool configured in vitest.config.ts)

Attempt log
-----------
1. 06:45 UTC (~7 minutes) – process timed out at harness 420s limit even though tests were still executing; partial stdout captured (not enough time for summary). Command re-run immediately afterwards.
2. 07:00 UTC (~15 minutes) – extended timeout to 900s; vitest continued to stream passing suites but CLI session expired again before completion.
3. 07:20 UTC (~18 minutes) – increased timeout to 1800s; vitest continued to run (all observed suites passing) yet CLI disconnected after ~18.5 minutes without emitting the final summary/coverage table. No FAIL lines appeared in the captured output, but the process likely exceeded the harness keep-alive window.

Next steps
----------
- Re-run the same command on a longer-lived runner (local terminal outside the Codex harness or CI) so vitest can finish (~20+ minutes expected for 2k suites with coverage).
- Alternatively split the suite (for example,  or per-domain commands) and merge LCOV outputs via nyc/vitest merge.
