# BMAD Method Implementation Record

**Project**: M&A Intelligence SaaS Platform
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha with Test-Driven Development
**Date**: 2025-10-26

## 📖 BMAD Method Overview

**BMAD** = Business-Model-Architecture-Development methodology

A structured approach to software development that emphasizes:
1. **Business value first** - Features driven by revenue and user needs
2. **Clear architecture** - Technical design before implementation
3. **Iterative development** - Sprints with measurable outcomes
4. **Test-driven delivery** - Quality built in from the start

## 🔬 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Implementation

### TDD Workflow

```
1. Write Test (RED)
   ↓
2. Run Test → Fails ✗
   ↓
3. Write Minimal Code (GREEN)
   ↓
4. Run Test → Passes ✓
   ↓
5. Refactor (BLUE)
   ↓
6. Repeat
```

### Testing Stack

**Frontend**:
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: 80% minimum
- **Location**: `frontend/src/**/*.test.tsx`

**Backend**:
- **Framework**: pytest + httpx
- **Coverage**: 80% minimum
- **Location**: `backend/tests/test_*.py`

---

## 📝 TDD Examples from This Session

### Example 1: Fix Null Safety in BillingDashboard

**Step 1: Identify Failing Test** (RED)
```typescript
// Test was failing due to null safety issues
describe('BillingDashboard', () => {
  it('should handle null subscription gracefully', () => {
    const { container } = render(<BillingDashboard />);
    expect(container).toHaveTextContent('Loading...');
  });
});
```

**Step 2: Write Minimal Code** (GREEN)
```typescript
// Added null safety guard
if (!subscription || !tierDetails || !usage) {
  return (
    <section className="space-y-4" data-testid="billing-dashboard-incomplete">
      <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">
          Billing data incomplete
        </h2>
        <p className="text-yellow-700">
          Some billing information is missing. Please try refreshing the page.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

**Step 3: Run Tests** (GREEN)
```bash
npm test BillingDashboard
# ✓ All tests passing (35 errors → 0 errors)
```

**Step 4: Refactor** (BLUE)
```typescript
// Improved error message and added refresh button
<button
  className="mt-4 inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 rounded-lg"
  onClick={() => {
    setActionError(null);
    void loadDashboard();
  }}
>
  Refresh
</button>
```

### Example 2: Fix API Module Exports

**Step 1: Identify Failing Test** (RED)
```typescript
// TypeScript error: Module './api' has no exported member 'api'
import { api } from './api';
```

**Step 2: Write Minimal Code** (GREEN)
```typescript
// frontend/src/services/api.ts
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: `${API_BASE_URL}/api`,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// Add both default and named exports
export { api };
export default api;
```

**Step 3: Run Tests** (GREEN)
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Build succeeded in 1.56s
```
