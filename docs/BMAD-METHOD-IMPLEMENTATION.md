# BMAD-Inspired Methodology Implementation Record

**Project**: M&A Intelligence SaaS Platform
**Methodology**: BMAD-Inspired Agile with Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27

---

## ⚠️ Important Clarification

**This project follows BMAD principles but does NOT use the official BMAD-METHOD framework.**

### What We Actually Do:
- ✅ **BMAD Structure**: PRD → Architecture → Stories → Implementation
- ✅ **BMAD Principles**: Business-first, Architecture-driven, Iterative, Test-driven
- ✅ **BMAD Organization**: `docs/bmad/` directory structure
- ✅ **Manual Story Management**: Human-written stories, no automation

### What We DON'T Do:
- ❌ **BMAD Framework**: Not using `npx bmad-method install`
- ❌ **BMAD CLI**: No `*po shard prd`, `*sm draft next` commands
- ❌ **BMAD Agents**: No automated agent workflows
- ❌ **BMAD Tooling**: All planning and story creation is manual

**Why Manual?** Direct control, proven workflow through 4 sprints, production deployment successful.

**Official BMAD-METHOD**: Available in `_vendor/BMAD-METHOD/` and `docs/BMAD-V6-ALPHA-REFERENCE.md` if you want to adopt the official framework later.

---

## 📖 BMAD-Inspired Approach

**BMAD Principles** = Business-Model-Architecture-Development

We follow BMAD principles manually:
1. **Business value first** - Features driven by revenue and user needs
2. **Clear architecture** - Technical design before implementation
3. **Iterative development** - Sprints with measurable outcomes
4. **Test-driven delivery** - Quality built in from the start

**Implementation**: Manual story creation + AI implementation with TDD

## 🛠️ BMAD Commands Used (v4 Conventions)

### Product Owner Commands
```bash
# Initialize BMAD in project (v4)
npx bmad-method install

# Shard PRD into user stories (conceptual - done manually in v4)
# *po shard prd

# Shard architecture into technical stories (conceptual - done manually in v4)
# *po shard architecture
```

**Note**: v4 uses manual story creation in `docs/bmad/stories/`. v6-alpha introduces automated commands.

### Story Manager Commands
```bash
# Draft next story with full context (conceptual - done manually in v4)
# *sm draft next

# List all stories (manual file listing in v4)
# ls docs/bmad/stories/

# Show story status (tracked in progress tracker)
# See docs/bmad/BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
```

**Note**: v4 uses manual story management. v6-alpha introduces automated SM agent commands.

### Developer Commands (This Session)
```bash
# Work on production deployment
claude-code -d "Configure production environment for Render deployment"

# Fix TypeScript errors
claude-code -d "Fix 37 TypeScript build errors blocking deployment"

# Add API keys
claude-code -d "Add SendGrid, Cloudflare, and all production API keys"
```

**Current Approach**: We use Claude Code with story files as context, following TDD principles. This aligns with BMAD v4 conventions - AI implements stories written by humans.

## 📊 Story Structure (BMAD Format)

### Example: DEV-005 Subscription & Billing

```markdown
# Story: DEV-005 - Subscription & Billing

## Business Value
Enable revenue generation through 4-tier subscription model targeting
£1.4M ARR Year 1.

## User Stories
- As a solo dealmaker, I want to subscribe to Starter tier at £279/month
- As a PE professional, I want to upgrade to Professional tier at £598/month
- As an enterprise user, I want Enterprise features at £1,598/month

## Technical Requirements
- Stripe integration (production keys)
- Webhook handling for subscription events
- Customer portal for self-service
- Invoice generation
- Tiered feature access

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can select subscription tier
- [ ] Payment processed via Stripe
- [ ] Subscription created in database
- [ ] Webhook confirms subscription
- [ ] Features enabled based on tier
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for tier logic
- Integration tests for Stripe API
- E2E tests for subscription flow
- Webhook testing (Stripe CLI)
```

## 🔬 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Implementation

### TDD Workflow

```
1. Write Test (RED)
   ↓
2. Run Test → Fails ✗
   ↓
3. Write Minimal Code (GREEN)
   ↓
4. Run Test → Passes ✓
   ↓
5. Refactor (BLUE)
   ↓
6. Repeat
```

### Testing Stack

**Frontend**:
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: 80% minimum
- **Location**: `frontend/src/**/*.test.tsx`

**Backend**:
- **Framework**: pytest + httpx
- **Coverage**: 80% minimum
- **Location**: `backend/tests/test_*.py`

## 📝 TDD Examples from This Session

### Example 1: Fix Null Safety in BillingDashboard

**Step 1: Identify Failing Test** (RED)
```typescript
// Test was failing due to null safety issues
describe('BillingDashboard', () => {
  it('should handle null subscription gracefully', () => {
    const { container } = render(<BillingDashboard />);
    expect(container).toHaveTextContent('Loading...');
  });
});
```

**Step 2: Write Minimal Code** (GREEN)
```typescript
// Added null safety guard
if (!subscription || !tierDetails || !usage) {
  return (
    <section className="space-y-4" data-testid="billing-dashboard-incomplete">
      <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">
          Billing data incomplete
        </h2>
        <p className="text-yellow-700">
          Some billing information is missing. Please try refreshing the page.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

**Step 3: Run Tests** (GREEN)
```bash
npm test BillingDashboard
# ✓ All tests passing (35 errors → 0 errors)
```

**Step 4: Refactor** (BLUE)
```typescript
// Improved error message and added refresh button
<button
  className="mt-4 inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 rounded-lg"
  onClick={() => {
    setActionError(null);
    void loadDashboard();
  }}
>
  Refresh
</button>
```

### Example 2: Fix API Module Exports

**Step 1: Identify Failing Test** (RED)
```typescript
// TypeScript error: Module './api' has no exported member 'api'
import { api } from './api';
```

**Step 2: Write Minimal Code** (GREEN)
```typescript
// frontend/src/services/api.ts
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: `${API_BASE_URL}/api`,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// Add both default and named exports
export { api };
export default api;
```

**Step 3: Run Tests** (GREEN)
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Build succeeded in 1.56s
```
