- Latest local commit on `main`: 4411923 (feat(deal-matching): add DEV-018 Phase 1 models and migration); branch is aligned with origin/main.
- 2025-10-29 08:59 UTC: `backend/venv/Scripts/pytest.exe backend/tests/test_valuation_api.py backend/tests/test_quota_service.py backend/tests/test_podcast_api.py -q` -> 60 passed (warnings only).
- 2025-10-29 08:34 UTC: `npm --prefix frontend run test -- src/pages/deals/valuation/ValuationSuite.test.tsx` -> 13 passed; full Vitest sweep pending after runner configuration change.
- Render production still awaiting redeploy with refreshed credentials; latest smoke evidence predates commit 4411923 and frontend curl continues to return Cloudflare 403.
- NEXT: Catalogue dirty/untracked files per BMAD story, rerun full pytest/Vitest with coverage, then schedule Render redeploy and capture smoke outputs.

## Service Status

| Service | Status | URL | Last Checked |
|---------|--------|-----|--------------|
| Backend API | Healthy (curl) | https://ma-saas-backend.onrender.com | 2025-10-29 07:11 |
| Frontend | Cloudflare 403 (expected) | https://apexdeliver.com | 2025-10-29 07:11 |
| Database | Connected | PostgreSQL (Render) | 2025-10-29 07:11 |
| Redis | Configured | Redis (Render) | 2025-10-29 07:11 |

**Frontend Note**: Headless curl continues to hit Cloudflare 403. Use a headed smoke run post-redeploy and log screenshots.

### Governance Snapshot (2025-10-29 08:59 UTC)
- Targeted backend (valuation plus podcast quota) and frontend (ValuationSuite) suites re-run and green; full regression still outstanding.
- BMAD tracker (`docs/bmad/BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`) and workflow status now reflect Phase 0.3 governance next steps.
- Dirty tree currently spans DEV-018 deal matching routes/schemas and shared test fixtures; mapping captured in `docs/100-PERCENT-COMPLETION-PLAN.md`.
- Render redeploy remains blocked on credential refresh and documentation updates.

## Outstanding Actions
1. Map remaining dirty/untracked files to their BMAD stories and either commit or stage follow-up work.
2. Run full backend pytest with coverage once database reset fixture verified, then refresh this dashboard with coverage metrics.
3. Execute full Vitest suite with coverage using updated runner settings; capture results.
4. Refresh Render environment variables, trigger backend/frontend redeploy, and attach smoke evidence.
