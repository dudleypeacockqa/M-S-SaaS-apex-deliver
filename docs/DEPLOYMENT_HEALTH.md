- Latest backend regression (2025-10-29 12:45 UTC): `backend/venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings` → **485 passed / 0 failed / 38 skipped**.
- Frontend spot checks (08:55–08:56 UTC): `ValuationSuite` + `PodcastStudio` specs all GREEN (33 tests); full Vitest sweep still pending due to fork runner issues.
- BMAD workflow next action: `npm --prefix frontend run test -- --run` to capture remaining RED/skip state before continuing DEV-008 roadmap.
- Render production still awaiting environment refresh; smoke script not rerun since credentials outstanding (last run recorded Cloudflare 403 on frontend).
- NEXT: Finish frontend baseline, refresh this dashboard with Vitest results, then unblock Render redeploy + smoke validation.

## Outstanding Actions
1. Map remaining dirty/untracked files to their BMAD stories and either commit or stage follow-up work.
2. Run full backend pytest with coverage once database reset fixture verified, then refresh this dashboard with coverage metrics.
3. Execute full Vitest suite with coverage using updated runner settings; capture results.
4. Refresh Render environment variables, trigger backend/frontend redeploy, and attach smoke evidence.
