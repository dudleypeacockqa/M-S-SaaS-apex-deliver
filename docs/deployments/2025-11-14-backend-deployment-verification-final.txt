DEPLOYMENT HISTORY ANALYSIS
===================================================================================

Recent Deployment Attempts:
- Multiple deployments failed with `update_failed` status
- Root cause: Database migration issues (UUID vs VARCHAR schema mismatches)
- Resolution: Migrations were fixed in commit 931faf97
- Current deployment: Backend is healthy on an older stable commit

Current Git HEAD: 5fed12922ef103bd87983fa33c1764e602ca52b7
Recent Commits:
- 5fed1292: docs(stories): update DEV-020 to COMPLETE, create DEV-021 retroactively

deployment failures for newer commits.
