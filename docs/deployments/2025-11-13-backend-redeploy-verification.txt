Render API Status
-----------------
Attempted to trigger redeploy via Render API
API Key: rnd_oMIm1MFTqRNH8sE4fgIiIXTsNAqM
Result: HTTP 401 Unauthorized
Note: API authentication issue, but deployment is healthy and functional

Conclusion
----------
✅ Alembic head verified (b354d12d1e7d)
✅ All smoke tests passing (10/10)
✅ Backend service healthy and responding
✅ Frontend service healthy and responding

The backend deployment is currently healthy and operational. While the Render API 
authentication failed, the service itself is functioning correctly with all 
critical endpoints responding as expected.

Next Steps
----------
- Continue with Phase 0 remaining tasks (Lighthouse/Axe CI, frontend coverage)
- Monitor deployment health via Render dashboard
- Consider updating Render API key if manual redeploy is needed in future
