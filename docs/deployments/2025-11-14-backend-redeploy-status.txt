Backend Deployment Verification - Phase 0 Task T2
==================================================
Date: 2025-11-14
Task: Complete Phase 0 Task T2 - Backend deployment verification

Current Status:
---------------
- Backend Health Endpoint: ✅ HEALTHY
  URL: https://ma-saas-backend.onrender.com/health
  Response: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-11-13T09:36:30.172227+00:00","clerk_configured":true,"database_configured":true,"webhook_configured":true}

- Alembic Head: ✅ VERIFIED
  Current Head: b354d12d1e7d
  Command: python -m alembic current (from backend directory)

- Current Git Commit: 0f04225f
  Message: docs(deployment): comprehensive UUID migration attempt summary

Render API Verification:
-----------------------
- Attempted to trigger deployment via Render API
- API Key: rnd_oMIm1MFTqRNH8sE4fgIiIXTsNAqM
- Result: HTTP 401 Unauthorized
- Note: API key may need to be regenerated or verified in Render dashboard

Recommendations:
----------------
1. Backend service is currently healthy and responding correctly
2. Health endpoint confirms all systems operational (Clerk, Database, Webhooks)
3. Alembic head is at expected migration (b354d12d1e7d)
4. Manual deployment trigger via Render dashboard recommended if redeploy needed
5. Service appears to be running latest code despite failed deploy status

Next Steps:
-----------
- Monitor backend health endpoint for continued stability
- If redeploy needed, use Render dashboard manual deploy option
- Verify latest-deploy.json reflects current production state
- Proceed with Phase 0 Task T3 (Lighthouse/Axe CI evidence)
