# Marketing Smoke Evidence - 2025-11-19

- **Command**: `node scripts/run-marketing-playwright.mjs`
- **Preview Startup**: Playwright `webServer` executed `npm run preview:test --prefix frontend`
- **Base URL**: http://127.0.0.1:4173 (default MARKETING_BASE_URL)
- **Build Inputs**: `frontend/.env`, `.env.production` (see dotenv banner in log)
- **Tests**: 7 Playwright specs (`tests/*.spec.ts`) executed via `playwright.dev.config.ts`
- **Result**: [pass] 7 passed, 0 failed (chromium project)
- **Artifacts**:
  - Raw console log: `docs/tests/2025-11-19-playwright.txt`
  - Playwright traces/videos (if needed) under `test-results/` (ignored in git)
- **Next Steps**: wire command into CI workflow + attach screenshot/video evidence when running against deployed preview.
