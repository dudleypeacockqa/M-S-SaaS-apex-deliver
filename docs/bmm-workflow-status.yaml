Architecture updated in docs/architecture.md to reflect Render via GitHub deployment. Solutioning gate check complete (docs/implementation-readiness-report-2025-11-10.md). Next up: sprint-planning + implementation workflows.
  - Sprint 1 execution in progress: pipeline template infrastructure restored (SP1-08) and UUID conversion migration for users prepared (revision e19f4551fcb0) to stabilize Render migrations.
