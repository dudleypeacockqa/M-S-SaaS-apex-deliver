# 100% Project Completion Plan
**Project**: M&A Intelligence Platform (ApexDeliver)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29 08:59 UTC
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha + TDD (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR)

---

## Current Delivery Snapshot
- **Backend tests**: `../backend/venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings` GREEN (485 passed / 38 skipped / 0 failed; 32.9s).
- **Frontend tests**: `npm --prefix frontend run test -- --pool=forks --maxWorkers=1` GREEN (533 passed / 3 skipped).
- **Coverage**: Last recorded Backend 83%, Frontend 85%; regenerate reports now that suites are stable.
- **Git state**: `main` == `origin/main`; working tree still dirty across DEV-008/DEV-018/marketing docs pending story alignment.
- **Migrations**: `backend/alembic/versions/a0175dfc0ca0_add_deal_matching_tables_dev_018_phase_1.py` staged; verify dependencies before applying.
- **Deployment**: Render redeploy pending (backend health 200 OK, frontend curl 403 via Cloudflare).
- **BMAD artefacts**: Tracker/workflow refreshed 2025-10-29 09:35 UTC with baseline sweep + new DEV-008 action.

### Dirty Tree Mapping (2025-10-29 09:35 UTC)
- `backend/app/services/document_service.py`, `backend/app/models/document.py` -> DEV-008 version retention & audit work in progress.
- `backend/app/api/routes/deal_matching.py`, `backend/app/models/deal_match.py`, `backend/tests/test_deal_matching_api.py` -> DEV-018 intelligent matching implementation.
- `backend/tests/conftest.py`, `backend/tests/test_database_reset.py` -> Phase A baseline fixture hardening.
- `frontend/vitest.config.ts`, `frontend/src/pages/deals/valuation/ValuationSuite.test.tsx` -> Phase A Vitest stabilisation artifacts.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md`, `docs/bmad/*` -> Governance artefacts aligned with latest baseline.

## Critical Unfinished Workstreams (ordered)

### 1. DEV-008 Secure Document & Data Room (P0)
- **Status**: Backend/Frontend coverage at ~52%; permission matrix, search, previews, and audit logging incomplete.
- **Actions**:
  - Promote missing backend tests (folder permissions, audit log export, search filters) RED → GREEN and align Alembic migrations/fixtures.
  - Deliver React components for folder tree navigation, permission modal, preview pane with Vitest coverage.
  - Integrate document export logging with valuation/document services and update story artefacts.

### 2. DEV-016 Podcast Studio Subscription Add-On (P0)
- **Status**: Backend quota service hardened; frontend gating/quota HUD still missing warning UX, video upload, transcription, live streaming.
- **Actions**:
  - Implement quota warning banner (80/90/100%), upgrade CTAs, entitlement tests.
  - Add audio/video upload pipeline with entitlement enforcement, YouTube metadata sync, transcription workflow.
  - Reach ≥90% backend / ≥85% frontend coverage for accompanying logic; update story doc and BMAD tracker with evidence.

### 3. DEV-012 Task Management & Workflow Automation (P1)
- **Status**: Feature largely unimplemented; automation suites absent.
- **Actions**:
  - TDD Task model/service (CRUD, state transitions, automation triggers) and endpoints.
  - Build frontend TaskBoard (drag-and-drop) plus notification hooks under Vitest.
  - Document automation templates and update story acceptance criteria.

### 4. DEV-018 Intelligent Deal Matching (P1)
- **Status**: SQLAlchemy models/migration present; services/API/UI/AI prompt flows outstanding.
- **Actions**:
  - Complete service layer + API endpoints with scoring/explainability, backed by tests.
  - Build MatchingWorkspace UI with gating analytics; integrate Claude prompts/mocks.
  - Document workflows and ensure deployment/migration steps captured.

### 5. MARK-002 Enhanced Marketing Website (P1)
- **Status**: Phase 2 of 10 complete; assets, SEO, analytics and Lighthouse audits outstanding.
- **Actions**:
  - Finish phases 3–10 with Vitest + Lighthouse evidence; update marketing docs/asset inventory.
  - Align Render preview assets and capture screenshots for release notes.

### 6. Operations & Deployment Hardening (P0/P1)
- **Status**: Render redeploy pending; smoke scripts partly updated; deployment checklists outdated.
- **Actions**:
  - Refresh `.env` alignment with Render secrets, rerun smoke tests (`scripts/run_smoke_tests.sh`), capture outputs in `DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md` & `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`.
  - Apply outstanding migrations (including DEV-018), confirm worker configs, update monitoring alerts.
  - Prepare release notes/PR summary once functional work converges.

### 7. Final QA, Documentation, and Handover (P0)
- **Status**: Dependent on upstream workstreams.
- **Actions**:
  - Run full backend pytest, full Vitest with coverage, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `uvicorn` + `npm run preview` smoke.
  - Update BMAD tracker, workflow status, story artefacts, release notes, ops checklists.
  - Confirm Render deployment health 100% (evidence: smoke logs, coverage reports, screenshots).

## BMAD Execution Roadmap
1. **Governance Sync**: Continue reconciling documentation (progress tracker, story files, deployment health) with verified test outcomes.
2. **BMM Phase 4 – Implementation Loops**: For each workstream above, execute `npx bmad-method run dev-story` to enforce RED → GREEN → REFACTOR, logging outputs in story docs.
3. **BMM Phase 5 – Verification**: After each story reaches GREEN, rerun targeted suites and capture metrics/coverage deltas in `BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`.
4. **BMM Phase 6 – Release & Operations**: Execute Render deployment checklist, document smoke tests, and prepare Conventional Commit + PR package including BMAD shard/ticket references.

---

## Immediate Next Actions (Next 48 Hours)
1. Update docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md and related ops artefacts with today’s valuation/Vitest results and current redeploy blockers.
2. Begin DEV-008 implementation loop: turn missing backend permission/search/audit tests RED and implement minimal code to go GREEN, updating story + tracker.
3. Kick off DEV-016 frontend quota UX enhancements via TDD once DEV-008 backend progress is underway, coordinating with entitlement APIs.
4. Review `backend/alembic/versions/a0175dfc0ca0_*` migration and integrate service/tests for DEV-018 as part of upcoming P1 work.
5. Maintain BMAD artefacts (progress tracker, workflow status, story files) after each suite run to keep governance state accurate.

Strict adherence to BMAD + TDD remains mandatory: every functional change starts with a failing test, all documentation updates follow immediately after GREEN cycles, and deployment artefacts must be refreshed before claiming completion.
