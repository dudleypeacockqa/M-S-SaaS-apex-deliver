# 100% Project Completion Plan
**Project**: M&A Intelligence Platform (ApexDeliver)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29 08:50 UTC
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha + TDD (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR)

---

## Current Delivery Snapshot
- **Backend tests**: docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md reports 431 passed / 38 skipped (run 2025-10-29 07:58 UTC). Re-run full pytest after stabilising current WIP because valuation, podcast, and deal-matching code changed locally.
- **Frontend tests**: frontend/test-output.txt shows ValuationSuite gating assertions still failing ("upgrade required" banner missing). Global Vitest suite remains RED until entitlement UX is completed.
- **Coverage**: Previous snapshot Backend 83 percent, Frontend 85 percent. Refresh after suites are green.
- **Git state**: Branch main matches origin/main at 634280f (NetSuite OAuth). Working tree has extensive uncommitted backend, frontend, migration, and BMAD doc edits that must be attributed to specific stories.
- **Migrations**: backend/alembic/versions/a0175dfc0ca0_add_deal_matching_tables_dev_018_phase_1.py staged but not applied. Validate dependencies and document rollout plan.
- **Deployment**: Render redeploy pending (Clerk, AI keys, CORS). docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md still records frontend Cloudflare 403 via curl; backend /health previously 200.
- **BMAD artefacts**: docs/bmad/bmm-workflow-status.md updated (Phase 0.2 command). Progress tracker entry to be appended after next Vitest run.

## Critical Unfinished Workstreams
1. **DEV-011 Valuation Suite (P0)**
   - RED Vitest specs for scenarios, exports, gating; backend export logging/tests incomplete.
   - Plan: reproduce failures, implement DCF/comparables/precedents enhancements, wire export queues, update story and tracker.
2. **DEV-008 Secure Data Room (P0)**
   - Remaining backend endpoints: version history, folder permissions, search, audit logs.
   - Frontend UI: upload with progress, folder tree, permission modal, previews.
   - Plan: add failing tests, implement minimal code, integrate Cloudflare R2 flow.
3. **DEV-016 Podcast Studio (P0)**
   - Quota banners, upgrade CTAs, video upload gating, transcription flow lacking.
   - Plan: extend backend quota states, build frontend HUD, cover with Vitest, document gating behaviour.
4. **Operations & Deployment (P0)**
   - Render env drift, smoke tests, deployment checklist, release artefacts outstanding.
   - Plan: align secrets, redeploy, capture smoke logs, update DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md and checklists.
5. **DEV-012 Task Automation (P1)**
   - No implementation; design task model/service, automation rules, Kanban UI.
6. **DEV-018 Deal Matching (P1)**
   - Models/migration staged; services, AI prompts, API, frontend workspace missing.
7. **MARK-002 Marketing Site (P1)**
   - Phases 3-10 pending (assets, SEO, analytics, CMS).
8. **Future P2 Features**
   - F-009 Doc generation, F-010 Content hub, F-012 Events, F-013 Community -> document stubs or MVPs after P0/P1 completion.

## BMAD Execution Roadmap
1. **Phase 0 - Stabilise Foundations**
   - Group dirty worktree by story; document intent in BMAD tracker.
   - Run focused Vitest (

   - Update DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md with fresh timestamps once tests re-run.
   - Execute Render env audit per RENDER-BACKEND-ENV-UPDATES.md and RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md.
2. **Phase 1 - Complete P0 Stories (DEV-011, DEV-008, DEV-016, Ops)**
   - Follow TDD loops for each story, enforcing RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR.
   - Update docs/bmad/stories, BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md, and workflow status after each green cycle.
3. **Phase 2 - Deliver P1 Differentiators (DEV-012, DEV-018, MARK-002)**
   - Use bmad-method dev-story workflow for each feature, maintain coverage targets (>=90 percent backend critical services, >=85 percent frontend).
4. **Phase 3 - Stub/Plan P2 Features**
   - Provide documented stubs or MVP implementations with failing tests converted to green where applicable.
5. **Phase 4 - Verification & Release**
   - Full pytest + Vitest + lint + build + smoke; capture coverage reports and screenshots.
   - Complete PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md, DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md, release notes, and PR summary.

- Catalogue uncommitted changes by story and update BMAD progress tracker.
- Prepare backend targeted pytest (valuation, podcast) to confirm regression scope.
- Execute Render environment update checklist before attempting new features.
- Schedule BMAD governance review to confirm plan sign-off.

Maintain strict BMAD plus TDD discipline: no implementation without a preceding failing test, document every GREEN cycle, and keep deployment evidence current before claiming completion.
