# 100% Project Completion Plan
**Project**: M&A Intelligence Platform (ApexDeliver)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29 09:45 UTC
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha + Test-Driven Development (strict RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR)

---

## Current Delivery Snapshot
- **Backend tests**: pytest --cov=backend/app last run reported **21 RED** (valuation + automation suites) per 2025-10-28 status; rerun required after outstanding WIP merges.
- **Frontend tests**: 
pm --prefix frontend run test currently **11 RED** cases in ValuationSuite.test.tsx; quota/entitlement specs still skipped.
- **Coverage**: Backend 83%, Frontend 85% (below >=90% backend target until valuation/automation tests restored).
- **Git state**: Branch main ahead of origin/main by 1 commit (1044b08), large dirty tree spanning valuation, podcast, marketing, scripts, and BMAD artefacts. No recent push/PR reflects the work.
- **Migrations**: New migration ackend/alembic/versions/a0175dfc0ca0_add_deal_matching_tables_dev_018_phase_1.py untracked; requires review, stamp, and documentation.
- **Deployment**: Render backend/frontend redeploy pending; docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md still notes smoke tests blocked by credential updates and Cloudflare 403 response.
- **BMAD artefacts**: docs/bmad/BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md and docs/bmad/bmm-workflow-status.md describe 100% green suites and completed phases; these require correction once the roadmap below is approved.
