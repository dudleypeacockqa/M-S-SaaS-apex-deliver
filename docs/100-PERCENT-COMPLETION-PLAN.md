# 100% Project Completion Plan
**Project**: M&A Intelligence Platform (ApexDeliver)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29 10:55 UTC
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha + TDD (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR)

---

## Current Delivery Snapshot (Phase 0 Governance Reset)
- **Backend tests**: ✅ **512/512 passing**, 38 skipped (credential-gated OAuth), latest run `pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings`.
- **Frontend tests**: ⚠️ **624/639 passing** with **15 failing** (DEV-018 MatchingWorkspace Vitest regressions).
- **Total**: ⚠️ **1136/1151 tests GREEN (98.7%)** – frontend failures block redeploy.
- **Git state**: Working tree dirty (`git status -sb` shows backend podcasts/api, deal matching UI/tests, new document components, governance docs).
- **Migrations**: ✅ `a0175dfc0ca0_add_deal_matching_tables_dev_018_phase_1.py` applied and current.
- **Deployment**: Render redeploy pending; smoke evidence to be refreshed post-frontend fix.
- **BMAD artefacts**: Tracker/workflow refreshed 2025-10-29 10:55 UTC with new test results + governance plan.

### Dirty Tree Mapping (2025-10-29 10:50 UTC)
- `backend/app/api/routes/podcasts.py`, `backend/tests/test_podcast_api.py` → DEV-016 video/transcription scaffolding.
- `frontend/src/components/documents/` → DEV-008 in-progress document UI (only `BulkActions` stub committed locally).
- `frontend/src/components/podcast/VideoUploadModal*.tsx` → DEV-016 video upload modal + tests (WIP).
- `frontend/src/pages/deals/MatchingWorkspace.tsx` & `.test.tsx` → DEV-018 frontend refactor causing current Vitest failures.
- `frontend/src/services/api/documents.ts`, `frontend/src/services/dealMatchingService.ts` → API client updates pending coverage fixes.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md`, `docs/bmad/*`, `completion.plan.md` → Governance reconciliation artifacts.

## Critical Unfinished Workstreams (ordered)

### 1. DEV-008 Secure Document & Data Room (P0)
- **Status**: Backend endpoints verified; frontend document workspace still outstanding (no FolderTree/PermissionModal/Upload UI).
- **Actions**:
  - Draft RED Vitest specs for folder navigation, permission management, upload progress, and bulk actions.
  - Implement React components (FolderTree, DocumentList, PermissionModal, UploadPanel, BulkActionsToolbar) and integrate with `documents.ts` API.
  - Add regression coverage for search, previews, and audit log exports; update story + BMAD docs when green.

### 2. DEV-016 Podcast Studio Subscription Add-On (P0)
- **Status**: Audio upload + quota gating live; video upload, transcription, YouTube metadata sync, and live streaming still pending.
- **Actions**:
  - Implement video upload modal + backend endpoint with tier enforcement and tests.
  - Integrate Whisper transcription pipeline, monthly quota reset, and upgrade CTA telemetry.
  - Reach ≥90% backend / ≥85% frontend coverage; document artefacts and ops guides.

### 3. DEV-018 Intelligent Deal Matching (P0)
- **Status**: Backend service/API complete; frontend MatchingWorkspace regressed (15 failing tests) and lacks criteria builder + analytics.
- **Actions**:
  - Fix Vitest failures (async waits, duplicate selectors) and finish match action workflows (view, save, pass, request intro).
  - Implement criteria builder modal + analytics widgets; ensure API client parity and add integration coverage.
  - Update story/PRD references once frontend reaches green.

### 4. MARK-002 Enhanced Marketing Website (P1)
- **Status**: Phase 2/10 complete; remaining SEO, Lighthouse, asset pipeline outstanding.
- **Actions**:
  - Finish phases 3–10 with Vitest + Lighthouse evidence; update marketing docs/asset inventory.
  - Align Render preview assets and capture screenshots for release notes.

### 5. Operations & Deployment Hardening (P0/P1)
- **Status**: Render redeploy paused pending frontend fix; smoke scripts outdated.
- **Actions**:
  - Refresh `.env` secrets, rerun `scripts/run_smoke_tests.sh production`, and capture outputs in `DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md` + `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`.
  - Apply outstanding migrations in staging, confirm worker configs, update monitoring alerts.
  - Prepare release notes/PR summary once functional work converges.

### 6. Final QA, Documentation, and Handover (P0)
- **Status**: Blocked by DEV-008/DEV-016/DEV-018 completion.
- **Actions**:
  - Run full backend pytest, full Vitest with coverage, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `uvicorn` + `npm run preview` smoke.
  - Update BMAD tracker, workflow status, story artefacts, release notes, ops checklists.
  - Confirm Render deployment health 100% (evidence: smoke logs, coverage reports, screenshots).

## BMAD Execution Roadmap
1. **Governance Sync**: Continue reconciling documentation (progress tracker, story files, deployment health) with verified test outcomes.
2. **BMM Phase 4 – Implementation Loops**: For each workstream above, execute `npx bmad-method run dev-story` to enforce RED → GREEN → REFACTOR, logging outputs in story docs.
3. **BMM Phase 5 – Verification**: After each story reaches GREEN, rerun targeted suites and capture metrics/coverage deltas in `BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`.
4. **BMM Phase 6 – Release & Operations**: Execute Render deployment checklist, document smoke tests, and prepare Conventional Commit + PR package including BMAD shard/ticket references.

---

## Immediate Next Actions (Next 48 Hours)
1. **Close Phase 0 governance loop**: Finalise documentation updates (`DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md`, story cards) and capture Vitest failure logs for reference in BMAD artefacts.
2. **DEV-008 frontend TDD cycle**: Write RED Vitest specs for FolderTree/PermissionModal/upload flow, implement components, and integrate with document APIs.
3. **DEV-018 regression fix**: Stabilise MatchingWorkspace tests (async waits, selectors), finish match action UI, and rerun full Vitest with coverage.
4. **DEV-016 continuation**: Resume video upload + transcription pipeline once DEV-008/DEV-018 are green; ensure backend quota coverage hits ≥90%.
5. **Ops readout**: After frontend suite passes, rerun coverage + smoke tests, update deployment checklist, and schedule Render redeploy.

Strict adherence to BMAD + TDD remains mandatory: every functional change starts with a failing test, all documentation updates follow immediately after GREEN cycles, and deployment artefacts must be refreshed before claiming completion.
