# 100% Project Completion Plan
**Project**: M&A Intelligence Platform (ApexDeliver)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29 09:45 UTC
**Methodology**: BMAD v6-alpha + Test-Driven Development (strict RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR)

---

## Current Delivery Snapshot
- **Backend tests**: `pytest backend/tests/test_deal_endpoints.py` → **25 passed / 3 failed** (stage update path returning 404 & helper import gaps). Full suite rerun pending after fixes.
- **Frontend tests**: `npm --prefix frontend run test -- src/pages/deals/valuation/ValuationSuite.test.tsx` → **13/13 GREEN**; global Vitest sweep to be rerun once backend regressions resolved.
- **Coverage**: Latest recorded metrics remain Backend 83%, Frontend 85%; rerun coverage after restoring backend suite.
- **Git state**: Branch `main` matches `origin/main`; working tree dirty across deal tests, BMAD docs, podcast story, valuation tests, and smoke scripts. No active PRs.
- **Migrations**: No new Alembic revisions detected during audit (a0175dfc0ca0 already tracked); confirm again post deal-stage fixes.
- **Deployment**: Render backend `/health` healthy at 2025-10-29T08:48Z; frontend root returning `200 OK`. Redeploy + smoke validation still outstanding for latest code.
- **BMAD artefacts**: Progress tracker updated 2025-10-29 09:00 UTC with alignment findings; workflow status now targets deal endpoint fixes before DEV-008/DEV-016 implementation.

## Critical Unfinished Workstreams (ordered)

### 1. DEV-011 Multi-Method Valuation Suite (P0)
- **Status**: Backend APIs partially implemented; front-end workspace missing exports, scenario editing, comparables/precedents workflows.
- **Gaps to close**:
  - Turn 11 RED Vitest specs to GREEN (scenario analytics, export CTA, growth-tier gating).
  - Backfill API/service tests (approx. 21 failing pytest cases) for comparables, scenario editing, export logging, Monte Carlo.
  - Wire export tasks to document service; ensure Celery fallback works in eager mode.
  - Update story doc and BMAD tracker with real pass/fail evidence.
- **TDD cadence**: Promote each skipped or failing spec, implement minimal code, refactor, rerun targeted suites before moving on.

### 2. DEV-008 Secure Document & Data Room (P0)
- **Status**: 26/50 tests GREEN; permission matrix, search, previews, and audit logging outstanding.
- **Actions**:
  - RED -> GREEN loops for missing API endpoints (folder permissions, document search, audit log export).
  - Implement React components for folder tree navigation, permission modal, and previews with Vitest coverage.
  - Align Alembic migrations and ensure seed data for fixtures.

### 3. DEV-016 Podcast Studio Subscription Add-On (P0)
- **Status**: Backend quota service partially hardened; frontend gating/quota HUD incomplete; video upload, transcription, live streaming pending.
- **Actions**:
  - Restore quota warning UX (80/90/100 percent), upgrade CTA flows, and gating tests.
  - Implement audio/video upload handling with entitlement checks, YouTube sync metadata, transcription pipeline.
  - Reach >=90% backend and >=85% frontend coverage for entitlement logic.

### 4. DEV-012 Task Management & Workflow Automation (P1)
- **Status**: No implementation; automation tests currently skipped or absent.
- **Actions**:
  - Design Task model/service with RED tests for CRUD, state transitions, automation triggers.
  - Build frontend Kanban TaskBoard with drag-and-drop and notifications under Vitest.
  - Document automation templates and update BMAD story.

### 5. DEV-018 Intelligent Deal Matching (P1)
- **Status**: New SQLAlchemy models staged; services/API/UI not wired; AI prompt/workflow missing.
- **Actions**:
  - Validate new migration (`a0175dfc0ca0`) and add matching service tests covering mandate creation, scoring, explainability.
  - Build frontend MatchingWorkspace with gating and analytics.
  - Define AI prompt templates and add integration tests/mocks.

### 6. MARK-002 Enhanced Marketing Website (P1)
- **Status**: Phase 2 of 10 complete; additional assets, SEO, analytics work outstanding.
- **Actions**:
  - Finish remaining marketing phases (3-10) with Vitest plus Lighthouse evidence.
  - Update marketing docs, assets inventory, and BMAD story.

### 7. Operations & Deployment Hardening (P0/P1)
- **Status**: Render environment refresh pending; smoke scripts partially updated; deployment checklist out of date.
- **Actions**:
  - Refresh `.env` alignment with Render secrets, rerun smoke tests (backend `/health`, frontend via headed request), capture output in `DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md` and `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`.
  - Ensure migrations applied, background workers configured, and monitoring alerts verified.
  - Draft release notes and PR once functional work converges.

### 8. Final QA, Documentation, and Handover (P0)
- **Status**: Awaiting completion of above workstreams.
- **Actions**:
  - Run full pytest plus Vitest with coverage, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `uvicorn` smoke, `npm run preview` smoke.
  - Update BMAD tracker, workflow status, story artefacts, release notes, and ops checklists.
  - Confirm Render deploy health 100% and package evidence (logs, screenshots, coverage reports).

## BMAD Execution Roadmap
1. **Governance Reset**: Reconcile dirty tree with active stories, verify test baselines, and correct BMAD tracker/workflow files before coding.
2. **BMM Phase 4 - Implementation Loops**: For each workstream above, run `npx bmad-method run dev-story` to enforce RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR cycles and capture outputs in story docs.
3. **BMM Phase 5 - Verification**: After each story reaches GREEN, execute targeted regression suites and update `BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` with timestamps, command logs, and coverage deltas.
4. **BMM Phase 6 - Release & Operations**: Execute Render deployment checklist, document smoke results, and prepare Conventional Commit + PR package including BMAD shard/ticket references.

---

## Immediate Next Actions (Next 48 Hours)
1. **Run governance check**: `npx bmad-method status` -> document CURRENT_WORKFLOW/NEXT_ACTION updates and capture in `docs/bmad/bmm-workflow-status.md`.
2. **Reproduce failing suites**: `pytest backend/tests/test_valuation_*` and `npm --prefix frontend run test -- ValuationSuite.test.tsx` to log current failure output for DEV-011 story.
3. **Stabilize DEV-011**: Promote failing tests to RED documentation, implement minimal fixes, and record progress in BMAD tracker plus story.
4. **Update Render status**: Confirm deployment drift (env vars, latest commit), note pending actions in `docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md` and ops checklists.
5. **Synchronize BMAD docs**: Align `BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`, `bmm-workflow-status.md`, and relevant story files with verified data from steps 1-4.

Maintaining strict BMAD plus TDD discipline is mandatory: no feature code without a preceding failing test, all documentation updated immediately after each GREEN cycle, and deployment artefacts refreshed before claiming completion.
