## The Challenge

### Fragmented Deal Management

Meridian's deal team was using a patchwork of tools:
- **Excel spreadsheets** for pipeline tracking (prone to version control issues)
- **Outlook folders** for email communications (lost context across team)
- **Dropbox** for document storage (no access controls or audit trails)
- **QuickBooks Desktop** for basic financial analysis (manual data entry, limited insights)

**Pain Points**:
1. **No single source of truth**: Each investment professional had their own tracking system
2. **Slow financial analysis**: 4-6 hours to manually build 3-statement models from QB exports
3. **Missed opportunities**: Deals fell through cracks due to lack of centralized visibility
4. **Document chaos**: Difficulty finding historical due diligence materials
5. **Limited collaboration**: Senior partners couldn't easily review deal status remotely

**Impact on Business**:
- Average 8.5 deals closed per 6-month period (below 10-deal target)
- 2-3 deals per year lost due to slow response times
- Investment team spending 40% of time on administrative tasks vs deal origination
- Difficulty scaling beyond 6 professionals without adding operations staff

- Average deal size: £15M enterprise value
- Average management fee: 2% of AUM
- **Incremental fee income**: 3.5 × £15M × 2% = **£1.05M additional AUM fees annually**

- Reduced consultant spend on ad-hoc financial analysis (£15K annually)

**Net ROI**:
- Platform cost: £1,598/month × 12 = £19,176/year

## Customer Testimonial

> "Before 100 Days & Beyond, our deal pipeline felt like controlled chaos. We knew we were missing opportunities, but couldn't pinpoint why. Within 3 months of implementing ApexDeliver, we closed 6 deals - more than we'd typically close in an entire quarter. The AI deal matching alone has surfaced 3 proprietary opportunities we wouldn't have found otherwise. It's transformed how we operate."
>
> **— James Hartley**
> **Managing Partner, Meridian Growth Partners**

> "The Financial Intelligence Engine saves me 4 hours per deal on manual ratio calculations. What used to take an entire afternoon now happens in minutes. I can spend that time on actually talking to management teams and digging into the business, which is where I add real value."
