**Client**: Velocity Manufacturing Ltd (SME, Manchester)
**Industry**: Industrial Manufacturing - Precision Components
**Implementation**: September 2025
**Plan**: CapLiquify FP&A

## Executive Summary

Velocity Manufacturing, a £45M revenue manufacturer, was drowning in manual cash forecasting processes. Their CFO spent 20+ hours weekly building 13-week cash forecasts in Excel, only to have them outdated within days. After implementing CapLiquify FP&A, they achieved **95% time savings** on forecasting (20 hours → 1 hour/week), improved forecast accuracy by **35%**, and avoided a potential covenant breach that would have triggered £2M in accelerated loan repayment.

**Key Results**:

## The Challenge

### Manual Excel Forecasting Hell

Velocity's CFO, Michael Davies, spent **20 hours every week** building and updating the company's 13-week rolling cash forecast. The process involved:

**Monday-Tuesday (10 hours)**:
1. Export AR ageing from Sage Intacct (manual CSV download)
2. Export AP ageing from Sage Intacct (separate CSV)
3. Copy-paste into master Excel forecast template (prone to formula errors)
4. Manually estimate payment dates based on customer payment history
5. Cross-reference with sales forecast from CRM (another manual export)
6. Build assumptions for new orders, seasonality adjustments

**Wednesday-Thursday (8 hours)**:
7. Chase operations team for production schedule (email back-and-forth)
8. Estimate material purchases and timing (no integration with procurement)
9. Model payroll (manual entry from HR spreadsheet)
10. Calculate estimated tax payments, loan interest, capex spend
11. Build out cash flow waterfall (opening cash + inflows - outflows = closing)

**Friday (2 hours)**:
12. Review with Financial Controller
13. Prepare PDF pack for CEO and lender
14. Discover errors, loop back to steps 3-11

**Pain Points**:
- **Outdated by Tuesday**: Forecast based on week-old data, immediately stale
- **Single-point forecast**: No scenario planning (no "what-if" analysis)
- **Error-prone**: Manual copy-paste led to 3-5 formula errors per month
- **No early warnings**: Covenant breaches discovered too late to course-correct
- **Lender friction**: Quarterly 13-week forecast took 3 days to prepare

**Crisis Moment** (August 2025):
In August, Velocity came within £150K of breaching their minimum debt service coverage covenant due to a surprise £800K delayed payment from a major aerospace customer. The breach would have triggered immediate loan renegotiation or £2M accelerated repayment. Michael only discovered the covenant risk on the day before the reporting deadline - too late to take meaningful action like accelerating collections.

## The Solution

### CapLiquify FP&A Platform Implementation

Velocity implemented CapLiquify FP&A (the Starter tier of 100 Days & Beyond) in September 2025 with the following features:
- **13-Week Direct Cash Forecasting** (automated AR/AP roll-forwards)
- **Working Capital Driver Analysis** (DSO/DPO/DIO tracking)
- **Multi-Scenario Modeling** (best-case, base-case, worst-case)
- **Lender-Ready PDF Pack Generation** (one-click reporting)
- **Sage Intacct Integration** (real-time GL, AR, AP sync)
- **Covenant Tracking Dashboard** (automated early warning alerts)

**Onboarding Timeline**:
- **Week 1**: Sage Intacct API integration setup (IT team support)
- **Week 2**: Historical data import (12 months of GL, AR, AP)
- **Week 3**: Forecast model configuration (DSO assumptions, payment patterns)
- **Week 4**: User training + first live forecast generated

**Configuration Highlights**:
- **Payment behavior modeling**: AI analyzed 12 months of AR history to predict customer payment patterns
- **DSO segmentation**: Separate DSO assumptions for aerospace (75 days) vs automotive (45 days) customers
- **DPO optimization**: Modeled strategic payment timing to maximize cash float
- **Scenario planning**: 3 standard scenarios (optimistic, realistic, conservative) with adjustable assumptions
- **Covenant monitoring**: Automated alerts when projected DSCR drops below 1.35x (10% buffer above 1.25x covenant)

## The Results

### Time Savings: 95% Reduction (20 Hours → 1 Hour/Week)

**Before CapLiquify**:
- Weekly forecasting time: **20 hours** (Monday-Friday)
- Lender reporting: **16 hours/quarter** (additional 3 days)
- Total CFO time on forecasting: **22%** of working hours

**After CapLiquify**:
- Weekly forecasting time: **1 hour** (Wednesday morning)
  - 30 minutes: Review auto-generated forecast
  - 20 minutes: Adjust assumptions if needed (new orders, payment delays)
  - 10 minutes: Generate and distribute lender-ready PDF
- Lender reporting: **2 hours/quarter** (automated report generation)
- Total CFO time on forecasting: **1.2%** of working hours

**Freed-Up Time Allocation**:
- 8 hours/week: Strategic financial planning (budgeting, capex planning)
- 6 hours/week: Commercial analysis (pricing, margin optimization)
- 4 hours/week: Treasury management (FX hedging, banking relationship)
- 1 hour/week: Working capital optimization projects

### Forecast Accuracy: 35% Improvement

**Accuracy Measurement** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error - MAPE):
- **Before CapLiquify** (manual Excel): MAPE = **18%** (industry average: 15-20%)
- **After CapLiquify** (AI-powered): MAPE = **12%** (best-in-class: 10-12%)

**Root Causes of Improved Accuracy**:
1. **Real-time data sync**: No lag between Sage and forecast model
2. **AI payment predictions**: Machine learning analyzed 12 months of customer payment behavior
3. **Automatic roll-forwards**: AR/AP ageing automatically updated weekly
4. **Scenario planning**: Conservative scenario provided 90th percentile downside protection

**Business Impact**:
- **Better cash management**: £500K reduction in average cash buffer needed (freed up for growth)
- **Improved supplier negotiations**: Confidence to extend payment terms with predictable cash flow
- **Reduced bank fees**: Avoided 3 overdraft incidents (£2,500 fees each time)

### Covenant Breach Avoided: £2M Value

**The Near-Miss** (October 2025):
Two months after implementing CapLiquify, Velocity faced another covenant test. A £1.2M aerospace order was delayed by 4 weeks due to customer supply chain issues. The CapLiquify early warning system flagged the potential covenant breach **21 days in advance** (vs. 1-day notice with old Excel model).

**Action Taken**:
- **Week 1**: Accelerated collections on 10 overdue accounts (recovered £250K)
- **Week 2**: Negotiated payment extension with 3 key suppliers (deferred £180K outflows)
- **Week 3**: Arranged bridge financing from factor (£300K AR advance)
- **Result**: DSCR landed at 1.32x (comfortably above 1.25x covenant)

**Avoided Consequences**:
- Immediate accelerated loan repayment: **£2M**
- Loan renegotiation fees: **£50K**
- Higher interest rate (300bps penalty): **£60K annually**
- Damaged lender relationship: Priceless

### Lender Relationship Improvement: 72-Hour Faster Reporting

**Before CapLiquify**:
- Quarterly 13-week forecast: 3 days to prepare
- Lender chasing CFO for reports (missed 2 deadlines in 2024)
- Manual PDF formatting, commentary writing

**After CapLiquify**:
- Quarterly 13-week forecast: 2 hours to prepare
- One-click PDF generation with:
  - 13-week cash forecast table
  - Cash waterfall chart
  - Working capital KPI trends (DSO/DPO/DIO)
  - Covenant compliance dashboard
  - Executive summary (auto-generated)
- **Result**: Lender now views Velocity as "best-in-class borrower" for reporting transparency

**Additional Lender Benefits**:
- **Real-time covenant monitoring**: Lender portal access to live DSCR dashboard
- **Scenario analysis**: Best/base/worst case cash projections build lender confidence
- **Faster credit decisions**: Improved reporting led to £2M facility increase approval in 2 weeks (vs. 6 weeks typical)

### Additional Benefits

#### Working Capital Optimization: £850K Reduction in CCC

CapLiquify's driver-based working capital analysis helped Velocity identify optimization opportunities:
- **DSO improvement**: 78 days → 65 days (focused collections on slow payers)
- **DPO optimization**: 45 days → 52 days (negotiated better terms with 3 suppliers)
- **Inventory reduction**: £1.2M → £950K (tighter JIT scheduling)
- **Cash Conversion Cycle**: 85 days → 63 days (**£850K cash freed up**)

#### Multi-Scenario Planning: Strategic Confidence

Previously, Velocity only produced a single-point forecast (essentially a guess). CapLiquify enabled 3-scenario planning:
- **Optimistic** (20% probability): Best-case customer payments, new orders land
- **Realistic** (60% probability): Base-case assumptions
- **Conservative** (20% probability): 2-week payment delays, order slippage

**Strategic Decisions Enabled**:
- **Capex timing**: Deferred £400K equipment purchase by 6 months based on conservative scenario
- **Hiring freeze**: Delayed 5 new hires until cash position strengthened
- **Credit insurance**: Purchased coverage for top 3 customers (£800K exposure)

## Customer Testimonial

> "CapLiquify gave me my life back. I was spending half my week in Excel hell, and the forecast was still wrong. Now I spend 1 hour on Wednesday morning reviewing the auto-generated forecast, and it's more accurate than anything I could build manually. The early warning system literally saved us from a covenant breach that would have cost £2M+. Best investment we've made in the finance function."
