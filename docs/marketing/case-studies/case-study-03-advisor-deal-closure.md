## Executive Summary

Marcus Chamberlain, an independent M&A advisor, struggled to compete with larger advisory firms due to limited resources and manual processes. After implementing 100 Days & Beyond's ApexDeliver Professional platform in July 2025, he closed **3 deals in 6 months** (vs. 1-2 deals annually previously), increased his average transaction value by **45%** (£8M → £11.6M), and built a pipeline of **22 active mandates** (vs. 6-8 before). The platform enabled him to operate like a 5-person team while remaining a solo practitioner.

**Key Results**:

- ✅ **45% increase in average deal size** (£8M → £11.6M)
- ✅ **22 active mandates** in pipeline (vs. 6-8 previously)
- ✅ **£525K in advisory fees** earned (6-month period)
- ✅ **"Institutional-grade" processes** as solo advisor

## Customer Background

**Advisor Profile**:
- **Name**: Marcus Chamberlain
- **Firm**: Chamberlain Corporate Finance Ltd (solo practice)
- **Location**: Birmingham, UK
- **Founded**: 2020
- **Experience**: 15 years in M&A (8 years Big 4, 7 years boutique firm)
- **Focus**: SME buy-side and sell-side advisory (£5M - £25M enterprise value)
- **Specialization**: Manufacturing, distribution, business services

**Historical Performance** (2020-2024):
- Average deals per year: **1.5 deals**
- Average deal size: **£8M enterprise value**
- Average advisory fee: **2.5%** of transaction value (£200K per deal)
- Annual revenue: **£300K** (highly variable)

**Challenges as Solo Advisor**:
- Competing against 5-10 person boutique firms
- Limited bandwidth to manage multiple mandates simultaneously
- Manual processes eating 60% of billable time
- Difficulty showcasing "institutional" capabilities to clients
- Pipeline management in head + scattered Excel files

---

## The Challenge

### The Solo Advisor Dilemma

Marcus faced the classic independent advisor challenge: **clients wanted boutique-firm capabilities at solo-advisor prices**, but he couldn't scale his manual processes without hiring staff.

**Daily Reality**:
- **8:00-10:00 AM**: Email triage, client updates (manually checking 15 inboxes)
- **10:00-12:00 PM**: Building financial models in Excel (3-statement, DCF valuations)
- **12:00-1:00 PM**: Client calls, deal discussions
- **1:00-3:00 PM**: Document preparation (CIMs, teasers, buyer presentations)
- **3:00-5:00 PM**: Deal sourcing (cold outreach, database research)
- **5:00-7:00 PM**: Catch-up on administrative tasks, pipeline tracking

**Pain Points**:
1. **Pipeline chaos**: Tracking 6-8 mandates in Excel + head, losing details
2. **Manual valuation work**: 6-8 hours to build DCF + Comps analysis per deal
3. **Document generation**: 10-12 hours to create CIM + teaser deck from scratch
4. **Deal matching**: Manually researching buyers, missing obvious strategic fits
5. **Data room management**: Dropbox folders with no audit trail or permissions
6. **Client perception**: Looked "small-time" compared to boutique firms with slick tech stacks

**Revenue Ceiling**:
- Maximum capacity: **8 active mandates** (beyond that, quality suffered)
- Win rate: **35%** of mandates (only 3 out of 8 progressed to LOI stage)
- Average time to close: **12 months** (industry average: 9 months)
- **Revenue cap**: 8 mandates × 35% win rate × £200K fee = **£560K** (theoretical maximum, never achieved)

**Crisis Moment** (June 2025):
Marcus lost a £15M sell-side mandate to a boutique firm because the client perceived him as "not having the infrastructure for a deal this size." The client specifically cited concerns about data room security, deal tracking, and valuation capabilities. This was his largest potential fee (£375K at 2.5%) and the loss was devastating.

3. **Competitive Process**: AI buyer matching led to more competitive auctions (higher valuations)

### Pipeline Growth: 22 Active Mandates (vs. 6-8 Previously)

**Before ApexDeliver**:
- Maximum capacity: 8 mandates (80% utilization meant deal quality suffered)
- Pipeline tracking: Excel + memory (details lost, follow-ups missed)

**After ApexDeliver**:
- Current pipeline: 22 active mandates
- Pipeline stages:
  - Qualification (8 mandates): Initial discussions, NDA stage
  - Engagement (7 mandates): Signed engagement letter, starting work
  - Marketing (4 mandates): Active buyer outreach, teaser stage
  - Due Diligence (2 mandates): LOI signed, closing process
  - Closed (1 mandate): Transaction completed

**Pipeline Management**:
- Kanban board view shows all mandates at-a-glance
- Automated task reminders (follow-ups, milestone deadlines)
- Client portal gives transparency (reduces "Where are we?" calls)
- No mandates slipping through cracks (vs. 2-3 per year previously)

**Projected Annual Revenue** (Based on 22-Mandate Pipeline):
- Assuming 35% win rate: 22 × 0.35 = **7.7 deals closed/year**
- Average deal size: £11.6M
- Average fee: 2.5% (blended buy-side/sell-side)
- **Projected revenue**: 7.7 × £11.6M × 2.5% = **£2.23M annually** (vs. £300K historically)

### "Institutional-Grade" Positioning: Competitive Advantage

Marcus now competes head-to-head with 5-10 person boutique firms on platform capabilities:

**Before**: "I'm a solo advisor, but I have great relationships and 15 years experience."
**After**: "I'm a solo advisor with institutional-grade infrastructure - data rooms, valuation suite, buyer databases - at boutique pricing."

**Client Perception Shift**:
- Data room with audit trails: "This is better than our solicitor's VDR"
- Valuation suite: "This DCF model is as sophisticated as any I've seen from Big 4"
- Deal matching AI: "You found 3 strategic buyers I'd never heard of"
- Pipeline dashboard: "I love having real-time visibility into deal progress"

**Win Rate Improvement**:

## Customer Testimonial

> "100 Days & Beyond transformed my practice overnight. I went from turning away deals because I couldn't handle the workload, to managing 22 active mandates and closing 3 deals in 6 months. The AI deal matching alone has paid for the platform 10x over - it surfaced a strategic buyer for Precision Tooling that I never would have found on my own. I now compete head-to-head with boutique firms that have 5-10 staff, and I'm winning."

For a solo advisor, his infrastructure is incredibly impressive. The secure data room audit trails gave our legal team confidence, and the automated buyer outreach process was faster than any boutique firm we've used. We've now given him 3 buy-side search mandates."
