# Master Admin Portal API

## Overview
All endpoints live under the /master-admin prefix, require Clerk authenticated users, and scope results to the caller's organization. Responses use the Pydantic schemas in backend/app/schemas/master_admin.py. Unless otherwise stated, timestamps follow ISO 8601 and identifiers are integers referencing the master admin tables.

## Conventions
- Authentication header: Authorization: Bearer <Clerk session token>.
- Default pagination: page=1, per_page=50, with maximum per_page=100.
- 404 indicates the requested entity does not exist or is not owned by the current user.
- 400 is returned when validation fails (for example, duplicate weekly goal).
