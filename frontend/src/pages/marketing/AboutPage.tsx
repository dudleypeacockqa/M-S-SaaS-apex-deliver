          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            We believe that every business, regardless of size, deserves access to the same level of financial and strategic tooling as the world's largest corporations. ApexDeliver was born from decades of hands-on experience in finance, technology, and M&A. We saw firsthand how disconnected systems, manual processes, and a lack of forward-looking data were holding businesses back.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Our founders, a team of seasoned ERP specialists, fractional CFOs, and AI engineers, set out to build a different kind of platform. One that doesn't just report on the past, but helps you shape the future. One that unifies the entire M&A and finance lifecycle, from the initial spark of a deal to the long-term value creation that follows.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Today, our platform is the engine behind hundreds of successful business transformations, delivering an average ROI of 300-500% for our clients. We're more than just a software company; we are your partners in growth.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 text-center mt-12">Our Vision</h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We envision a future where every business has the financial intelligence and strategic tools needed to thrive. Where cash flow is predictable, pricing is optimized, and M&A deals are executed with confidence and precision. Where technology empowers finance teams to be strategic partners, not just record-keepers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-6 leading-relaxed">
            By combining CapLiquify's forward-looking FP&A capabilities with ApexDeliver's comprehensive M&A suite, we're creating a unified platform that supports businesses at every stage of their growth journey‚Äîfrom stabilizing cash flow to executing transformational deals and beyond.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              ApexDeliver was founded by Dudley Peacock, an M&A professional who experienced firsthand the accessibility problem in the industry. After years of working with both enterprise platforms and makeshift solutions, Dudley recognized a massive opportunity: build a platform that delivers enterprise-grade capabilities at accessible pricing, powered by modern AI.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              The vision extends beyond just building great software. ApexDeliver is designed as a revenue-generating engine to fund a systematic LBO acquisition strategy, with a long-term goal of achieving ¬£200M in personal wealth and establishing an institutional private equity fund. This alignment of interests ensures the platform's success is directly tied to creating value for users‚Äîwhen ApexDeliver grows, everyone benefits.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              With a background in M&A execution, technology, and entrepreneurship, Dudley brings a unique perspective: building tools that solve real problems for real dealmakers, not just theoretical features that look good in a pitch deck.
