Push to GitHub → trigger Render auto-deploy\n2. Verify production deployment health\n3. Begin Document Room frontend completion (12h)\n   - Upload progress UI + drag-and-drop\n   - Permission management modal\n   - Audit log export + preview\n\n**Progress Impact**: 67% → 75% complete (+8% this session)\n- Test stability: 98.6% → 100% (+1.4%)\n- Deployment: Verified healthy\n- Phase 1: 40% complete (Sprints 1.1-1.3 done, 4 sprints remaining)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e","createdAt":"2025-11-11T05:56:17Z"},"status":"live","trigger":"new_commit","createdAt":"2025-11-11T05:57:01.02083Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-11T06:07:38.79135Z","startedAt":"2025-11-11T05:57:00.96808Z","finishedAt":"2025-11-11T06:07:11.995972Z"},"cursor":"hWJGXdqgKX4wYWhyMGZuczczZGFpNmEw"},{"deploy":{"id":"dep-d49cm663jp1c73c41msg","commit":{"id":"5e5ed71c940a525155f72350b0f75d712ad1d420","message":"docs(bmad): add Session 2025-11-11B - Phase 2A complete (tabbed Deal Details)","createdAt":"2025-11-11T05:34:59Z"},"status":"deactivated","trigger":"new_commit","createdAt":"2025-11-11T05:35:22.253755Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-11T06:07:11.990644Z","startedAt":"2025-11-11T05:35:22.199933Z","finishedAt":"2025-11-11T05:45:02.161432Z"},"cursor":"HmTNCBF7teRtNjYzanAxYzczYzQxbXNn"},{"deploy":{"id":"dep-d49cd42g0ims73e504o0","commit":{"id":"6da3b0e5f73beeda1189b8654cb327ebde5e8b48","message":"docs(bmad): add Session 2025-11-11 - Phase 1 Housekeeping complete\n\nPhase 1: Autonomous Execution - Housekeeping \u0026 Foundation ✅\n\n**Achievements:**\n- Phase 1.1: Consolidated 31 files (commit fea5c01) ✅\n- Phase 1.2: Pushed to Render (both services deploying) ✅\n- Backend: LIVE and HEALTHY ✅\n- Frontend: build_in_progress ⏳\n\n**Metrics:**\n- Backend: 663 tests, 82.9% coverage ✅\n- Frontend: ~1,061/1,066 tests (99.5% pass rate) ✅\n- Project: 66% complete (+1% from Phase 1)\n\n**Next:** Phase 2 - Deal Pipeline Completion (F-002)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e","createdAt":"2025-11-11T05:15:42Z"},"status":"deactivated","trigger":"new_commit","createdAt":"2025-11-11T05:16:01.979615Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-11T05:45:02.156028Z","startedAt":"2025-11-11T05:20:25.941917Z","finishedAt":"2025-11-11T05:30:55.764903Z"},"cursor":"HmTNCBF7teRkNDJnMGltczczZTUwNG8w"},{"deploy":{"id":"dep-d49cadpr0fns73dae4d0","commit":{"id":"fea5c0130e9e9090c49d3922c35e696eb7141b11","message":"docs(bmad): consolidate Phase 1 autonomous execution work-in-progress\n\nConsolidated all outstanding work from autonomous execution initiative (Phase 1: Housekeeping \u0026 Foundation).\n\n**Backend Updates:**\n- Valuation service: Enhanced DCF calculation logic\n- Tests: Comprehensive valuation service test coverage\n- Coverage: 82.9% maintained (backend/coverage.json)\n\n**Frontend Updates:**\n- NavigationMenu: Updated feature access control logic\n- Master Admin components: Enhanced ActivityList, FocusTimer, GoalCard, NudgePanel\n- Deal matching: Updated MatchCard test assertions\n- CreateDealModal: Test improvements\n- Button component: Minor UI refinements\n- Test status: 5 failures remaining (StatCard: 2, NavigationMenu: 3)\n\n**Documentation - Comprehensive Planning:**\n- docs/100-PERCENT-COMPLETION-PLAN.md (updated roadmap)\n- docs/P0-PHASE-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md (new - phase completion summary)\n- docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md (deployment health tracking)\n- docs/PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md (deployment procedures)\n- docs/bmad/BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (progress tracking)\n- docs/bmad/bmm-workflow-status.md (workflow state)\n\n**Test Artifacts:**\n- frontend-test-full-output.txt (complete test run)\n- frontend-test-results.txt (test summary)\n- frontend-test-quick.txt (quick test results)\n- p0-frontend-final-verification.txt (P0 verification)\n\n**Deployment Artifacts:**\n- latest-deploy.json (Render deployment status)\n- latest-deploy-check.json (deployment health check)\n- fix_production_alembic.py (migration fix script)\n\n**Scripts:**\n- verify_deployment.sh (deployment verification script)\n\n**Cleanup:**\n- Removed patch.diff (obsolete)\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Backend: 663 tests, 82.9% coverage ✅\n- Frontend: ~1,061/1,066 tests passing (99.5%) ✅\n- Deployments: Both LIVE and healthy ✅\n- Remaining work: Fix 5 frontend test failures\n\n**Next Steps** (Phase 1 completion):\n1.

Converts users.id from UUID to String(36) (lines 76-79)\n2.
