## âœ… What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Critical Bug Fixes**

#### Blog Page (FIXED)
- **Issue:** Blog page showing "No posts yet" despite database having posts
- **Root Cause:** Multiple issues - frontend using placeholder data, backend API had field name mismatch, CORS configuration
- **Solution:** 
  - Created `/api/blog` endpoint in backend
  - Fixed `featured_image` vs `featured_image_url` field name mismatch
  - Updated Blog.tsx to fetch from API using `VITE_API_URL`

- **Solution:** Added click-outside detection, Escape key handler, and improved mouse event handling
