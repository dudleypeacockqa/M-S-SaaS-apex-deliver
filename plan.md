# DEV-011 Backend Finish Plan – Updated 2025-10-29

## Completed
- ✅ Step 1: Full backend pytest baseline re-established (Celery eager mode already configured).
- ✅ Step 2: Valuation service coverage pushed to 92% via new service operation tests (27 cases total).

## Step 3 (In Progress): Documentation & Deployment Sync
- Refresh `docs/bmad/BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`, `docs/bmad/bmm-workflow-status.md`, and story notes with Step 2 outcomes.
- Update `docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md` with 2025-10-29 backend (200 OK) and frontend 403 observations.
- Capture git status + latest commit/push summary and confirm Render health references.

## Next Loop Targets
1. **DEV-011 Exports & Scenario Editing (RED)**
   - Add failing tests covering valuation export logging (PDF/Excel) and scenario edit flows.
   - Implement export services + Celery task hand-off, refactor for deterministic seeds.
2. **DEV-016 Quota Warning UX (RED)**
   - Promote Vitest quota banner specs, wire warning thresholds (80/90/100%) in backend + frontend.
3. **Governance**
   - After docs sync, prepare Render smoke plan (backend + frontend) and update deployment checklist once quota/UI features land.
