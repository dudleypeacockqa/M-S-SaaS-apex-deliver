# 100% Completion Roadmap – Updated 2025-10-29

## Phase Overview
1. **Current Status & Governance Sync**
   - Capture baseline (`git log -1` → 0f512b9) and document outstanding work across podcast, valuation, and marketing features.
   - Reconcile BMAD records (`docs/bmad/BMAD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`, `docs/bmad/bmm-workflow-status.md`) and align `docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md` metrics with current regressions.

2. **Complete DEV-016 Acceptance Criteria**
   - Backend: finalize quota warnings, entitlement flows, transcription/YouTube pathways in `backend/app/services/quota_service.py`, `backend/app/api/routes/podcasts.py`, `backend/app/services/youtube_service.py` with matching tests.
   - Frontend: implement gating/UX updates in `frontend/src/pages/podcast/PodcastStudio.tsx` (+ tests) covering warning banners, upload CTA copy, YouTube publish interactions.

3. **Supporting Tooling & Coverage**
   - Restore fixtures/tests (e.g., `backend/tests/conftest.py`, replacements for `test_database_reset.py`) and resolve API client/test debt surfaced in `git status`.
   - Run full suites (`python -m pytest`, `npm --prefix frontend run test`) targeting ≥90% backend / ≥85% frontend coverage; eliminate skips/failures.

4. **Deployment Readiness & Render Verification**
   - Update deployment assets (`docs/DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH.md`, `docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`, `scripts/run_smoke_tests.sh`, `scripts/verify_migrations.sh`).
   - Collect production secrets, redeploy backend/frontend on Render, execute smoke tests, record evidence in deployment docs, confirm 100% health.

5. **Release Packaging & Sign-Off**
   - Update story docs (DEV-016, MARK-002, DEV-011) with final acceptance evidence and regression results.
   - Refresh BMAD trackers/workflow status, prepare release notes and coverage summaries.
   - Ensure clean working tree, commit/push final changes, and tag the release after approvals.

## Execution Notes
- Operate under BMAD v6-alpha with strict TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR) for each deliverable.
- Record every regression run and deployment action in the corresponding doc.
- Maintain ≥90% backend and ≥85% frontend coverage; resolve skips/xfails before sign-off.
